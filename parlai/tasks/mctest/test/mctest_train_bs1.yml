      basketball, but he wasn''t very good at it. Every morning he would get up and
      go out to the baseball field, and every night he would dream about his favorite
      players. He loved the Yankees, and knew he would someday play for them. One
      day when Tom was practicing at the field, a man in a nice suit came out of a
      long car and walked over to Tom. The man said that he worked for the Yankees,
      and was there to see Tom play! Tom was so excited he could scream! Knowing that
      the man was watching, he played the best game ever that day. When he was done,
      the man told Tom that he was good enough to play for the Yankees, and to pack
      his things right away. Tom hurried home as fast as he could, and started to
      pack up all his clothes. His mom walked in and asked what Tom was doing. "I''m
      going to play for the Yankees ma!" Tom said. Tom''s mom was so excited that
      she took Tom and the whole family out for dinner. Grandpa, Grandma, Mom and
      Dad were all there, and bought Tom a big cake! As Tom said goodbye to everyone,
      he couldn''t help but feel sad that he would be gone for so long. "Don''t worry
      son, we''ll be at all the games cheering you on!" said his dad. This made Tom
      happy again, and as he left to be with his team, he knew that he had finally
      made it. multiple: What sports did Tom play?'

    text: 'Once upon a time, there was an old man named John. John loved to eat peaches.
      In fact, John''s whole family, including his mother Stephanie, his father Bob,
      and his brother James loved to eat peaches. John would eat peaches in the morning
      for breakfast, in the afternoon for lunch, and in the evening for dinner. John
      and his best friend, Rick, shared their love for peaches. One day John and Rick
      started a peach farm so that they would never run out of their favorite fruit.
      They planted hundreds of peach trees and waited for them to bear fruit. After
      6 years of waiting, 1 lonely peach finally grew on one of the trees John and
      Rick planted. They picked the peach and brought it home. They waited until the
      weekend to eat it in case more peaches grew, but none did. John and Rick were
      sad and confused about their farm. They planted hundreds of trees and were sure
      that there would be thousands of peaches for them to eat in no time. Another
      peach never grew on their farm for 17 years. One day, a mighty crack of thunder
      led to a strong storm. Lightning hit the ground over and over, and John and
      Rick were scared their trees might be killed. The next morning, every tree on
      the farm had more than 10 peaches on it. John and Rick started shouting for
      joy. one: What did John and Rick both love?'

      day when he saw something moving in the corner of the yard. He put down his

      across the grass.

      ewlineCarefully, Kerry followed the frog as it jumped across the grass. He didn''t
      know where the frog had come from or where it was going, but he knew that frogs
      needed water. He wanted to help the frog.

      for sand. He filled it up with water and brought it to the backyard.

      ewlineIt took him some time to find the frog again. It seemed to be moving slower
      than it had before. He waited for it to pause, then scooped it up with his bare
      hands and dropped it into the water. He watched the frog swim around for a bit,
      and then carried the pail around to the front of the house.

      ewlineIt was a short way to a nearby creek running through his neighborhood.

      heavier and heavier as he walked. Finally, he reached the creek. He set the
      pail down next to the water and tipped it over until the frog was swimming in
      the stream. multiple: Why did Kerry put the frog in the stream?'

    text: 'While walking in the park on Monday with my granddaughter Tina, we saw
      an ice cream truck pull up on the street. "Can we get ice cream, Nana?" asked
      Tina. "Sure we can!" I answered. As we started heading up the hill to the truck,
      my granddaughter was scared by a bird who had swooped by her face. "Nana, that
      bird almost made me fall down the hill!" Laughing at what was said, I answered,
      "If you fell you might have taken Nana down with you!" Once we reached the ice
      cream truck, Tina saw that they not only had ice cream but also carried popcorn,
      hotdogs, juice and soda. "Nana, instead of ice cream may I get popcorn and juice?"
      she asked. "If that is what you want, you sure can!" I answered. We got our
      food and headed to the picnic table. On our way over we saw a child who Tina
      knew from her kindergarten class. "Nana, may we go and say hello to Mary?" "Let''s
      go!" We made it over to where Mary and her family were sitting and Tina saw
      a bright blue butterfly. She did everything she could to try and catch that
      pretty butterfly but it kept flying way to high for her to catch. "That is okay",
      she said, "Butterflies need to be left out to fly free".  Mary asked Tina if
      she wanted to go over her house and play Barbies when we left the park, instead
      of going home. So we went over and the girls had a wonderful time and were both
      tired after a long day. We needed to get a good night''s sleep to enjoy our
