      \ /media/GRANT DOBSO to point to /media/ipod . i want a prog to think that grant\
      \ dobso is really ipod . \n ln -s /media/GRANT* /media/ipod . \n thx . no that\
      \ did the same thing . unless its supposed to put a folder in the other folder\
      \ . \n /media/ipod would now be a symbolic link to media/GRANt . \n well im\
      \ looking at it..and it adds a symbolic link..but the link is on the grant folder\
      \ IN ipod . so the grantfolder has the symbolic link . \n im not sure what you\
      \ mean . \n it doesnt seem to be working . it makes a copy of grant and throws\
      \ it into ipod and the symbolic link is on the grant folder in ipod ."
