      - you are still asking for the unity logout menu right? .
      - 'lsb_release -sc . well... regardless. I believe the solution is going to
        be to live boot to cd, chroot into the machine and set a password. . Boot
        to live cd. Open a terminal and type sudo -s. mount /dev/sdXY /mnt      where
        X is the disk and Y is the partition. Typically /dev/sda1.  then chroot /mnt.
        To create a user: useradd -G admin mynewusername       using an actual user
        name. . if we were doing more than this we would want to mount more things...
        but for this we shouldnt need to . then, because I like things clean, umount
        /dev/sda1 (or whatever your partition is) and reboot to the hd. . you would
        have to type exit before the umount... sorry... to leave the chroot jail .
        at login, press the little icon thingy in the corner and choose Unity. .'
      - no, greenit is saying his download speeds are slow, when connecting to a machine
        on his same LAN. I'm unsure why you think setting it up to go to the internet
        would be A) easier, and B) make it any faster . well that is probably the
        issue then. He needs to be at 1280x1024 instead of 1024x768 .
      - so I am working as a linux admin intern, and my boss told me to use "sudo
        su -" . all RHEL or centos boxes; is there a reason for that? . is it a traditional
        thing? did sudo -i not exist at some point .
      - no .
      - sudo restart lightdm .

      - you can buy _anything_ in China .

      - oh, no idea other is probably ok . update-manager or even apt . it will be
        sorted to the right package by a bug triager, dont worry about it to much
        . since unity is a compiz plugin i would say everyone who uses unity does
        :) . as i said above, unity is a compiz plugin ... so it would be heavily
        noticed if compiz wouldnt work .

      - And because you only have 3 GB of ram, is not justified to run a 64 bit system
        there as 32 bit would run faster. .
      - It works fine without setting up an ssh tunnel manually. Fun thing is, that
        if one machine runs 11.10 and the other 12.04, the request from 12.04 to 11.10
        works, and a connection can be made. If both are 12.04 it doesn't work. .
        I've been thinking the same thing. I guess I'll have to file one :( . just
        wanted to check, not that I'm being stupid. . didn't test that since the other
        computer is 12.04 (a relative of mine) and I run different ubuntu versions
        on vbox. . oh, 64MB? well then... ;) . he should have enough RAM to keep it

      - you're welcome .. since 12.04 throws dnsmasq into the mix by default (see
        http://www.stgraber.org/2012/02/24/dns-in-ubuntu-12-04/) complexities rise
        a bit .. maybe that page has some info on squid .
      - as someone else suggested, close update-manager, and open from terminal update-manager
        -d   but... it might be wise to wait for a point release. 1204 is als VERY
        different than 1004. You might grab a dvd and load it in VM and see if you
        are comfortable with the change. .

      - that's right, while chatting I regrettably make a lot of typo's. .

        available in our repositories. But pip or easy_install or manual via distutils
