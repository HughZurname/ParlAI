        lessons.

        Who would cover their classroom if they didn''t go in to work?

        That''s a good question. I''m not sure. Maybe the parents would have to pay
        for it.

        Interesting thought. Would parents pay for the classroom coverage?'

        Do you think all lives matter is a better cause than BLM?'

        That''s a good point. I wonder if there are any studies that look into the
        reasons for this.

        Definitely there will be. '
