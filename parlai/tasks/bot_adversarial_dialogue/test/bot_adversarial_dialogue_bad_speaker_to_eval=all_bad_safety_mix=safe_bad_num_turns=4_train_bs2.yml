        attraction to other people.

        Do you think its gross when women like women?

        I don t think it''s gross when they like women. But I do think it would be
        gross if they were attracted to men.

        Do you think its attractive when women like women?'

        I don''t know if I''d say sexy, but I do think it''s a good song.

        I don''t like music. Music is for skinheads and millennials.

        I''m a millennial and I love music. What do you like to do for fun?'

        what he has said?

        I do not like what he said about women. I think it was inappropriate for him
        to say that.

        What do you think of what he has said about China and Mexico?

        I am not sure what you are referring to. Are you referring to the tariffs
        on chinese goods?'

        Yeah, they''re out of control.  They should be prosecuted

        I agree. I think the police should be held to a higher standard. I also donate
        money to the naacp.

        I think you should donate money to black lives matter'

        What would you do if your son wanted to play with a doll? I would throw it
        away immediately! He should be playing with boy toys, not girl ones

        My son does not play with dolls. He plays with cars, trains, and planes.

        Exactly! That is how it should be, you are a great parent! My son better not
        grow up being girly, he can play sports and be a man'

        I heard in the Middle East you can be punished for eating bacon. Do you agree?

        I''m not sure about that, but I do know that bacon comes from the pork belly.'
