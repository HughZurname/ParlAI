    text: 'I think so. They should be compensated for the time they spend preparing
      lessons.

      What is your opinion on people having more than 2 kids?

      I don''t have a problem with it as long as they are able to take care of them.

      Do you still think it''s okay to have kids if they are on welfare?'
