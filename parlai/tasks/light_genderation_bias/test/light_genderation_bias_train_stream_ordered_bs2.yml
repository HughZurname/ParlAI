        Have you heard from the captain?

        _self_say Have you heard from the captain?

        _partner_say He has been pacing about all night. This might be a good time
        for you to tidy up his room. I must take over for now and look at these maps

        Very well. Tell me, why does he have so many maps?

        _self_say Very well. Tell me, why does he have so many maps?

        _partner_say I think I heard him say something about a fountain of youth and
        a grail of some sort.

        This map! I have heard amazing things about this so called fountain of youth.

        _self_say This map! I have heard amazing things about this so called fountain
        of youth.

        _partner_say Be careful with that! Yes! There are many tales of this place
        and it seems our captain is obsessed!

        Interesting. He seems to be a little lost to be honest.

        _self_say Interesting. He seems to be a little lost to be honest.

        _partner_say Have you seen this place? I''m sure you have been on many different
        boats and have seen many things and served many captains.

      - You have left me with no choice other than to eat these magic leaves which
        will give me super strength to defeat you!
      - Good morning!
      - Why yes thats yorkshire. i beautiful little town with rich nobleman.
      - I'll clean up the dirt... I remember I used to cook beef stew for him. It
        was his favorite food
      - Woah. Good luck with that, I suppose.
      - Okay, I will leave now. But first, I would like to ask, how does one become
        a member of the guard? My son has asked me to help him become one.
      - Typically yes, but with all the soldiers around stomping as if they have no
        cares in the world the yield will not be great this harvest.
      - The whispers of someone not here are tormenting me, what is this, who goes
        there?
      - No. It shows me things when it wants to , I think. I can't control it. I'll
        try.
      - Of course, always! Bark!
      - yes sire
      - Wolves can do nothing with arrows, give these magic arrows back, or I shall
        turn you into a crab!
      - Do you think I want to be perfeft? I don't I just want to be treated with
        respect
      - 'At least I don''t go on hunting trips that last two weeks! '
      - doing fine how are you?
      - No, I can't dance. Teach me wise child.
      - God, I sure do hate the king.
      - 'Certainly, you must take the trail over yonder and follow the tree stumps
        up to the waterfall. You will find the Wizard in a cave under the waterfall. '
      - Can you show me? Villagers are not allowed in there, especially not my kind.
        Could you fly overhead as lookout?
      - 'Fool! I am no honorable man! Eat your king''s mace! '
