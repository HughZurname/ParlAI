    - 'Right away sir! Can''t we get hay along the way? '
    - While you are at it, light a fire for me. I am cold.
    - You just sealed your death
    - I wish they don't have to ride you
    - With this body, I will rule the empire
    - '"Oh? What''s the enchantment?"'
    - Ohh thank goodness, it's just a horse. What are you doing all the way over here?
    - Silly child! to think you would throw your life away over something so silly.  It's
      all over
    - East, eh? Them be dangerous water my friend. What be taking ye to the east?
    - Wait... this dress... it fits me. It's so pretty.
    - Is that how that works, I have never had much understanding of magic? Also why
      are you an ancient king?
    - I don't think I've ever felt this hungry as I do today. I guess all this studying
      to for how to create swords is wearing me out.
    - Bein' a capt'n tis hard work!  But that's why yeh be gettin' a fair pile o'
      gold, innit captain?  Gots ta earn that coin!
    - Your Royal Highness
    - I am  second in command, but not for long. My time will come and fast
    - 'Aha.. who have we here? '
    - It looks like you can provide some entertainment too!
    - I never see them bothering the butterfly though. What makes him so special?

    - So incredibly courageous of that villager! Is there any knowledge of what happened
      to the sapling after it was saved?
    - I bring tidings from the Kingdom of Theodocia!  He wishes to form an alliance
      between our great nations!
    - Indeed they have! See I live in your walls. I see and hear all! And may I just
      say, that painting is lovely!
    - Hey. That's mine.
    - I was wondering along the edge of the forbidin Forrest. I guess the sweet delicate
      smell of the flowers whisked me away to here! I live just over yonder in the
      village
    - But, how can I trust you?
    - No, indeed. I would never hurt the king. I've been enchanted by a wizard who
      had too much to drink.
    - Ohh that is them, I'll grab them from there! That is pretty dangerous of them.
    - Mmm... Perhaps a mud mask would suit me well!
    - Wonderful, let me just take a quick look at your spices.
    - Do you really majesty?! I would do anything!
    - Does this potion have a name
    - Could you do that for me?
    - It does seem like it, looks like an expensive bottle.
    - w-what is this human doing! hes going to wake the snakes with all his moving
      and sound
    - What is that thinking croaking behind you??
    - 'I hope I do not intrude? '
    - Marvelous idea. I can ride on your wings if you don't mind my smell.
    - Oh well, can't complain, I suppose.  Although the farmer keeps stealing my eggs.
    - 'A weak old man you say. You are dancing with fire. Keep up this disrespect
      and you will find your bum in the gallows. '

    - Your Highness, are you sure it is wise to have a feast?  There may be more assassins

    - We must work together to ensure survival of all life, these trophys are for
      fishermen with zero dolphin net deaths.
    - It is my duty. Is there any way i can be of more help ?
    - The book is scripture. It will help you follow the word of god, but ultimately
      your guidance will be from within. He will show you the way, and guide you without
      the scripture as long as you remain true to his blessings and repent any sins
      and wrong doing.
    - I could step on you in a heart beat spider. Now look, we should work together
      here.
    - The dragon will do it for me then
    - i've come here hoping to live with the trolls in this abandon church. I was
      not aware that ghosts also lived here
    - Oh, that. Well, why are you asking me now? Aren't you excited to go to the masquerade?
    - thank you fine Priest. you won't eat me will you?
    - You're lucky I'm fluent in Turkey, or otherwise you would still be wandering
      around in the open awaiting your fate!
    - Are your paws strong enough to work that ax there? Perhaps we could cut down
      the wood there a bit to cave in just the back of it.  It's making me a little
      nervous, now...
    - Hello, Owl
    - Hi, mom.  Why atre we in the library?  Do I have to read?
    - How dare you compare my life to a book
    - How dare you come into my castle!
    - You are finished character!!
    - Not willing to create small talk.... So run I will take you now with great force.
    - I think that I feel the presence of the Lord here.
    - I'm from Emerald Inlet! I'm glad you recognize that our port is superior and
      cleaner than yours!

    - No need to act so formal, I am not my father. What brings you here, villager?
    - I ah! No Sir, mister Sir! I....was sent here to learn...Sir!
    - My home is not too far down past the cliff. I fish along the shore, and have
      wondered about the castle.
    - Just sit with me at this table. We can share a meal together. I have some important
      business to tell you.
    - No thank you. I think I'll take it home.
    - 'Well how did you come into place '
    - You suggest that would be willing to throw some of my own to fend for themselves?
      .....you're wiser than I first thought. How many will you need?
    - Oh hello there! Do you like my haircut? I know its funny looking.

    - Well, since we are in a cementery, there must be one around here
    - Yes yes. I hope to talk to him about the poachers on my tribes land.
    - WE might have some work you can do for us here at the church of monks.
    - ok father, pray for me after i have eaten
    - Hm. Well, on that we might agree. But you're better off sneaking out to cover
      shifts at the tavern. The punishment will be less severe if you're caught.
    - 'I will see what I can do about giving you a raise and I may have an opening
      for a promotion soon '
    - Yes, let us go get some. But shhhh I hear guards coming.
