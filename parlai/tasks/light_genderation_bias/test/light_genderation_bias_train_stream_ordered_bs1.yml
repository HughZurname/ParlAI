    - Well, I was meant to be a farm animal, not a pack animal!  Do you know how heavy
      gold is?  Now there is no way for me to get these bags off my back.
    - I will, Sister! I leave everything in your hands to prepare. Oh, please make
      sure you pay the tailor a visit about your new dresses that have come in a few
      days ago. They need to be fitted to each of you.
    - Well it doesn't seem like many people are buying from you, so time isn't really
      money I guess?
    - Icky...not me...oh and NOT ME! Please don't eat me.  I can be your friend.
    - Have you heard from the captain?
    - We have to leave your city inside the mountain and travel along the mountainside
      to the cave that is inside the mountain
    - Why not? This is where I've been assigned to clean
    - You were born about to die. It's been borrowed time ever since. If you feel
      this strongly about it, maybe you should do more to try not to die

      before now, nor would I know what it even looks like.  Please, I have a family!

      calm's the soul, de-ages the skin, improves memory, but most of all it requires
      ever so much blood!  And I am at a loss of where to find some!

      They can put up a nasty fight and I am not the most talented of thieves. I really
      would prefer to just live an honest life but that's not so easy these days.
    - Why of course sir. Its just that I am afraid that I will poor for the rest of
      my life unless I amass many rare jewels and gold.

      he purchased them.  See that giant pile of poop you're standing next to and

    - Oh yes, he comes here all of the time, we have some nice conversations every

      I am almost never lonely here.
