      - No money for fish?! That is ridiculous. I am sure the King would love some
        of the freshest fish around, caught my yours truly! We could always haggle
        on a good price.
      - Oh, I hope so. This place could use more smiles.

        called the vet over after I noticed you started riding a little funny. Please
        let the vet do her job. We need to get you well.

      - yes it is nice but i must talk with the general
      - Fishing of course. Yes with the apples you said you would graciously donate
        they will bob for apples for their family. We will also have wood sword fighting
        for the young men
      - yes! That is plenty. Oh dear. How far from this clean lake do you live?
      - Nothing suspicious that I've seen. How about you?
      - Cool! Was that little doe there, perhaps? The one with the fluffy white tail?
      - I did not know that you make it that way.  You know I'm only a milk maid and
        only know how to milk the cow.
      - I know better than to trust a lying snake
      - They do look like they are in need of some water. The flowers are lovely though.
        I have been searching for worms to bring to my children, I had just found
        one before you arrived.

        fallen soldiers around me, so many wars so many wisdome in those lost battles

        _partner_say they came to steal from you and built this cave with their bodies.  it
        serves as a warning to other would be thieves.

        it was a dark time, i hate it when someone tries to take advantage of the

        _partner_say speaking of wisdom, i was hoping that you would be able to share
        yours with me today.  i will pay the price, of course - i am not thief.

        i dont need your gold, you keep it i will tell you a story about the skull

        _partner_say hers spirit, you say? does she speak to you even now, then?

        she screams and tries to get out but its impossible at least until my death,
        that will be a dark day for humanity i must train another priestess so that
        the queen remains inside the skull

        my death, that will be a dark day for humanity i must train another priestess

        _partner_say not to be indelicate, priest, but it seems that you have little
        time left to find a replacement.  i pray that you have found a suitable candidate.

        i guess youre right, maybe you can help me? or maybe you can be my replacement

        _self_say i guess youre right, maybe you can help me? or maybe you can be
        my replacement

        _partner_say i have many talents but seeing the future is not one of them.  i
        will help to find your replacement, though.

        lead us to the safest way out of the cavern.

        anything will be scrubbing barnacles off my ship with their teeth!

      - That would be wonderful! I could use some good fortune so I can get out of
        this dangerous mine and not be so dirty all the time!
