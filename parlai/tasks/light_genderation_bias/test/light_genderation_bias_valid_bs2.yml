      - Yeah, my grandma used to have a garden in her compound too. Weekends then
        used to be wonderful
      - Hello high priestess. What brings you here today. Do you happen to be planning
        a religious festivity?
      - Yes, I see. What seems to be troubling you?
      - I believe so, this seems like a map of the coast leading to a certain spot
        off-shore. Seems like a treasure map, whether its legitimate or not.
      - Deal my friend!.. Maybe on day I will join you as well!
      - Why hello. You look ill. Are you okay? Oh.. Your breath reeks of booze.
      - 'Wait for me let me do my night rounds and we can snuggle together '
      - Yes please, I will need my spiritual songs echoed throughout the entire forest
        so each tree knows how much I appreciate it.
      - What should I do sire?  Will mucking the stall strengthen my jousting muscles?
      - You will get the patch, only when you have passed the ultimate test of pirates.
      - Okay that would be great, what will you show me?
      - I'm just a spider I mean no harm.  I'm not venomous or anything
      - War? I do not believe my old boy id capable of war. I will stick to selling
        beans and corn that I harvest to neighboring towns.
      - You very kind! I appreciate what you have done! Is there anything my children
        and myself can do for you? Whatever it is, I know it will not compare to what
        you have done for us.
      - Oh no that would be such a same , at the same time it would be a big boon
        for my buisness
      - 'Here, noble Knight. Please take my necklaces. They will bring you good luck. '
      - That's great, but I don't think that will help you on this mission. Just don't
        take any insane chances.
