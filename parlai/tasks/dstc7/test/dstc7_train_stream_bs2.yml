        I''ve tried using DISPLAY:=1 as I use this number when connecting with a VNC
        client but it doesn''t wo. rk either...

        participant 2: is X running?

        participant 1: I think so: https://paste8.com/HvhlT6vO.  maybe you prefer
        this check: https://paste8.com/0OhcBmfB

        participant 2: these days you use lightdm (or gdm, kdm) to start X, so i''d
        try to kill what''s there but unreachable with "sudo killall X" and then "sudo
        service lightdm start"

        participant 1: what do I kill precisely? because it says "X: no such process"

        participant 2: nothing, X wasn''t running if you get that, proceed with "sudo
        service lightdm start" and then test your script

        participant 1: alright but "start: Job is already running: lightdm"

        participant 2: worm: try restart

        participant 1: I did but I get "No protocol specified. " followed by "xhost:
        unable to open display :0" when executing my script (i.e. https://paste8.com/4XQiHrXZ).
        does it matter I run everything from a root tty? because that''s what I do

        participant 2: ahh, not a good idea to try to start X as root no.  now your
        regular users ~/.Xauthority file is probably owned by root, check that.  what
        does "ls -la ~/.Xauthority" give you?

        participant 1: yes I got /root/.Xauthority I need to append an entry for my
        regular user right?

        participant 2: check if your regular user still owns his .Xauthority file
        and remove the one for root

        participant 1: there is no .Xauthority for my regular user I''m afraid

        participant 2: well, copy the one from root to the user /home and make him
        own it, use the chown command.  sudo chown $USER:$USER $HOME/.Xauthority

        participant 1: done, but running $sudo service lightdm start; returns "Sorry,
        user <myuser> is not allowed to execute ''/usr/sbin/service lightdm start''
        as root on <myhost>."

        participant 2: is the regular user in the sudoers?

        sudo fdisk -l again and paste result again, along with your /boot/grub/menu.lst

      text: 'participant 1: can anyone help!?. my question is: I''m using ubuntu,
        in wubi, and I keep trying to download packages, but it will stop downloading
        2 packages until the finish, it''s having problems with getting progrms that
        have translating in the name...

        participant 2: that it really strange. But if it is related to wubi, probably
        few people have experienced it here.

        participant 1: @ well the thing is it will try to download everything and
        almost all of it will not download, those ones that dont download, all they
        do is just say failed

        participant 2: is the installation new?

        participant 1: @ absloutly, just installed hour ago

        participant 2: run: sudo apt-get update and see if that helps.

        participant 1: @ ok just wait a sec

        participant 2: that may not do anything

        participant 1: @ its frozen at 98% Waiting For Headers

        participant 2: hmm. It sometimes takes a little bit. If it really can''t complete,
        it may be that there is a repository it can''t access or some other network
        problem.

        participant 1: @ its download some packages now :D
