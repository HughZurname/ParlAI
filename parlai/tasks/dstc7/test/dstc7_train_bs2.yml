        Ubuntu 9.10 won''t detect it when I plug it into one of the USB ports. Can
        I do something to command Ubuntu to read detect what is plugged into the USB
        port?

        participant 2: try "lsusb".  If you do it before and after plugging it in,
        the new entry should be your device.

        participant 1: jfcaron: OK - I get a read out when I enter "lsusb" before
        plugging it in. Terminal just stalls when I enter that command after plugging
        it in ...

      - you need to choose them via the numbers
      - a wine game bug is hardly critical.  step one , check if it runs at all in
        linux via the appdb
      - oh, time they finish that stuff
      - you can try. Apparently, people have changed tires on their car while driving
        at highway speed.
      - if you are using dmraid then that is a kernel side thing.  try a PCI-X RAID
        card with 512Mb cache
      - dont know m8.  always VNCed after logged in...
      - double click the little speaker icon on your panel and check what device it
        has checked..  and check the settings in TS to see if its the same.
      - spread the love ;-)
      - you mean you want your /home moved to a serperate partition?
      - ok. back ina bit.
      - I think you need to open your firewall to allow connections from outside then.
      - see the private message from ubotu....
      - you can tell the OS to use compiz as you want
      - only one way to find out .... give it a shot.
      - possibly.  but you've probably highlighted the problem there
      - add a new panel then to that panel add the trash Can the Show Desktop the
        workspace switcher and the list of windows
      - well, i have most privileges with a checkmark.  except send and receive faxes,
        use scanners, and use tape drives
      - ok in a terminal, lsusb ...look for video device
      - it's not too hard by hand anyway
      - why do you need it ?.  changing the alsa version can have serious effects
        on your system

      text: 'participant 1: Hello, could someone please lend me a hand? I can''t seem
        to isntall ubuntu on my laptop. I get a "The debootstrap ptohtam exited with
        an error(return value 1)" error

        participant 2: sorce: Are you installing i by hand or having ubuntu do everything
        for you?

        participant 1: By hand? I am at the step where the base system is installing.  Not
        exactly sure what you mean though. I just downloaded the 5.10 cd

        participant 2: Sorce: Okay, so its installing it for you (Your not copying
        files via a livecd and then downloading the rest). sorce: What kind of laptop
        are you using, do you know off hand?

        participant 1: Yea, it''s an old Compaq presario 1600. I''ve installed Ubuntu
        on 4 other machines without any problems..  I think I found the problem. CD
        integrity check failed.

        participant 2: Ah, that would do it :-... atleast its something simple.

        participant 1: Yea, I should have probably ran that test earlier >.<
