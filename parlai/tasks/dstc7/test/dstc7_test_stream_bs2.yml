        Have a couple of issues related to video and im not sure if it relates to
        having x-swat ppa on my previous install. basically when I hot undock my laptop
        from my docking station the graphics glitch out and everything but the mouse
        cursor flickers. only way to resolve is switch to a vterm and kill Xorg..
        was wondering what troubleshooting steps I can take before I restore my 12.04
        system image.

        participant 2: common upgrade practice is to remove all custom PPAs *beforehand*
        so that could be a good start

        participant 1: I had forgotten id enabled it :( since everything worked so
        well. I tried the x-swat repo in trusty but theres no updated packages. I
        tried the xorg-edgers ppa and these drivers have the same issues

        participant 2: my point was to run built-in, not look for yet more PPAs to
        break and confuse things :)

        participant 1: presumably after the update I had built in? that was acting
        broken

        reboot. Can anyone tell me how to avoid this?

        participant 2: which history? firefox?

        participant 1: no, terminal history

        participant 2: open nautilus and browse to /home/yourusername press ctrl+h
        to show hidden files is there a file called .bash_history there?

        participant 1: yes, there is a .bash_history file there

        participant 2: right click that file choose properties>permissions is it set
        to read write and your user name in owner and gropup. group

        participant 1: I just checked. it was not owned by me. So I changed the ownership
        of the file. Was this the only cause. If so then I can confirm this on next
        boot.
