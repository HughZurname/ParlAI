    text: 'Negotiate with your opponent to decide who gets how many of each item.
      You must both agree on the distribution of items (or you both get zero), but
      try to get as much value as you can. There are 1 book(s), each with a value
      of 4, 3 hat(s), each with a value of 0, and 1 ball(s), each with a value of
      6.

      i need the ball and 1 hat please .'
