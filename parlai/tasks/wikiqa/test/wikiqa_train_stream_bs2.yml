      - Deepwater drilling is the process of oil and gas exploration and production
        in depths of more than 500 feet.
      - By this definition, there are approximately 600 deepwater wells in the Gulf
        of Mexico.
      - It has been economically infeasible for many years, but with rising oil prices,
        more companies are investing in this area.
      - Major companies working in this sector include Diamond Offshore , TransOcean
        , and Baker Hughes .
      - 'There are basically two kinds of mobile deepwater drilling rigs: semi-submersible
        drilling rigs and drillships .'
      - Drilling can also be performed from a fixed-position installation such as
        a floating spar (platform) or tension-leg platform.
      - Recent industry analysis has estimated that the total expenditure in the global
        deepwater infrastructure market will reach $145bn in 2011.
      - “Not all oil is accessible on land or in shallow water.
      - You can find some oil deposits buried deep under the ocean floor.” ...Using
        sonic equipment, oil companies determine the drilling sites most likely to
        produce oil.
      - Then they use a mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) to dig the initial well.
      - “The reason for the resumption of such drilling, analyst say, is continuing
        high demand for energy worldwide.”
      - America needs the oil so it is almost necessary to face the high risks that
        come with deepwater drilling in order for Americans to continue to carry on
        their everyday lives.
      - “The Energy Department recently projected that gulf oil production would expand
        from its 2011 level of 1.3 million barrels a day, still nearly a quarter of
        total domestic production, to 2 million barrels a day by 2020.”
      - Deepwater drilling affects the environment in both negative and positive ways.
      - Although Deepwater drilling rarely causes oil spills it is still a hazardous
        possible outcome.
      - Oil spills result in oil sinking to the bottom of the ocean smothering plant
        life leaving fish without food and shelter to survive.
      - On the other hand deepwater drilling effects the environment in a positive
        ways too.
      - In time once the deepwater oil well is not in use anymore plants will grow
        on and around the well making a cave or cavern like shelter ideal for animals
        to thrive in.
      - Deepwater drilling also lets us see the depths of the ocean floor that are
        hardly ever seen.
      - ”Cameras on rovers at the bottom of the wells record footage and take photos
        of rare fish that are in there natural habitat, giving scientist a look at
        animals they rarely seen”(Chevron Corporation)."
