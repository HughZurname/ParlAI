      - Lolita is a 1962 comedy-drama film by Stanley Kubrick based on the classic
        novel of the same title by Vladimir Nabokov , centres around a middle-aged
        man who becomes obsessed with a teenage girl.
      - The film stars James Mason as Humbert Humbert, Sue Lyon as Dolores Haze (Lolita)
        and Shelley Winters as Charlotte Haze with Peter Sellers as Clare Quilty.
      - Due to the MPAA 's restrictions at the time , the film toned down the more
        provocative aspects of the novel, sometimes leaving much to the audience's
        imagination.
      - The actress who played Lolita, Sue Lyon , was fourteen at the time of filming.

        were going to be, he probably never would have made the film.

      - An antibody (Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large Y-shaped
        protein produced by B-cells that is used by the immune system to identify
        and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses .
      - The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target, called an antigen
        .
      - Each tip of the "Y" of an antibody contains a paratope (a structure analogous
        to a lock) that is specific for one particular epitope (similarly analogous
        to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with
        precision.
      - Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected
        cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its
        target directly (for example, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential
        for its invasion and survival).

      - The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system
        .
      - Antibodies are secreted by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell
        .
      - Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted
        from the cell, and a membrane -bound form that is attached to the surface
        of a B cell and is referred to as the B cell receptor (BCR).
      - The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation
        of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories
        called plasma cells , or memory B cells that will survive in the body and
        remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure.
      - In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary
        to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation
        following antigen binding.
      - Antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large
        heavy chains and two small light chains .
      - There are several different types of antibody heavy chains, and several different
        kinds of antibodies, which are grouped into different isotypes based on which
        heavy chain they possess.
      - Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals, which perform different
        roles, and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different
        type of foreign object they encounter.
      - Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, a small region
        at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies
        with slightly different tip structures, or antigen binding sites, to exist.
      - This region is known as the hypervariable region.
      - Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen.
      - This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize
        an equally wide variety of antigens.
      - The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations
        of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites (or
        paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene,
        which create further diversity.
      - Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes
        the base of the heavy chain to another, creating a different isotype of the
        antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region.
      - This allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the
        immune system.
