    - Heavy metal (often referred to as metal) is a genre of rock music that developed
      in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and in the
      United States.
    - With roots in blues rock and psychedelic rock , the bands that created heavy
      metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion
      , extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness.
    - Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are generally associated with masculinity
      and machismo .
    - The first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin , Deep Purple and Black Sabbath
      attracted large audiences, though they were often derided by critics, a status
      common throughout the history of the genre.
    - In the mid-1970s Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding
      much of its blues influence; Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and
      an increasing emphasis on speed.
    - Bands in the New Wave of British Heavy Metal such as Iron Maiden followed in
      a similar vein.
    - Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as " metalheads
      " or " headbangers ".
    - During the 1980s, glam metal became a commercial force with groups like Mötley
      Crüe and Poison .
    - 'Underground scenes produced an array of more extreme, aggressive styles: thrash
      metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica , Megadeth , Slayer
      , and Anthrax , while other styles of the most extreme subgenres of metal like
      death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena.'
    - Since the mid-1990s, popular styles such as nu metal , which often incorporates
      elements of grunge and hip hop ; and metalcore , which blends extreme metal
      with hardcore punk , have further expanded the definition of the genre.

    - 'Assassination attempts and plots on Presidents of the United States have been
      numerous: more than 20 attempts to kill sitting and former presidents, as well
      as the Presidents-elect , are known.'
    - 'Four sitting presidents have been killed: Abraham Lincoln (the 16th President),
      James A. Garfield (the 20th President), William McKinley (the 25th President)
      and John F. Kennedy (the 35th President).'
    - 'Two presidents were injured in attempted assassinations: former President Theodore
      Roosevelt (the 26th President), and President Ronald Reagan (the 40th President).'
    - Although the historian J.W. Clarke has suggested that most American assassinations
      were politically motivated actions, carried out by rational men, not all such
      attacks have been undertaken for political reasons.
    - Some attackers had questionable mental stability, and a few were judged legally
      insane.
    - Since the Vice President of the United States has for more than a century been
      elected from the same political party as the President, the assassination of
      the President is unlikely to result in major policy changes.
    - This may explain why political groups typically do not make such attacks.

    - Gaius Julius Caesar (, July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC) was a Roman general , statesman
      , Consul and notable author of Latin prose.
    - He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman
      Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire .
    - In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed a political alliance that was to
      dominate Roman politics for several years.
    - Their attempts to amass power through populist tactics were opposed by the conservative
      elite within the Roman Senate , among them Cato the Younger with the frequent
      support of Cicero .
    - Caesar's conquest of Gaul , completed by 51 BC, extended Rome's territory to
      the English Channel and the Rhine .
    - Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both when he built a bridge across
      the Rhine and conducted the first invasion of Britain .
    - These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse
      the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the
      death of Crassus in 53 BC.
    - With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to lay down his military
      command and return to Rome.

      a legion , leaving his province and illegally entering Roman territory under
      arms.

      and the era of the Roman Empire began.
