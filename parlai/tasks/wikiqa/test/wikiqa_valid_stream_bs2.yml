        the September 11, 2001 attacks .
      - The Oklahoma blast claimed 168 lives, including 19 children under the age
        of 6, and injured more than 680 people.
      - The blast destroyed or damaged 324 buildings within a sixteen-block radius,
        destroyed or burned 86 cars, and shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings.
      - The bomb was estimated to have caused at least $652 million worth of damage.
      - Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local, state, federal, and worldwide
        agencies in the wake of the bombing, and substantial donations were received
        from across the country.
      - The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated eleven of its Urban
        Search and Rescue Task Forces , consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted
        in rescue and recovery operations.
      - Within 90 minutes of the explosion, Timothy McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma
        State Trooper Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested
        for unlawfully carrying a weapon.
      - Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Terry Nichols to the attack;
        Nichols was arrested, and within days both were charged.
      - Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices.
      - McVeigh's co-conspirator, Terry Nichols, had assisted in the bomb preparation.
      - Motivated by his hatred of the federal government and angered by what he perceived
        as its mishandling of the Waco Siege (1993) and the Ruby Ridge incident (1992),
        McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly
        fire that ended the siege at Waco.
      - The official investigation, known as "OKBOMB", was the largest criminal investigation
        case in American history; FBI agents conducted 28,000 interviews, amassing
        of evidence, and collected nearly one billion pieces of information.
      - The bombers were tried and convicted in 1997.
      - McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001, and Nichols was
        sentenced to life in prison .
      - Michael and Lori Fortier testified against McVeigh and Nichols; Michael was
        sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to warn the U.S. government, and
        Lori received immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony.
      - As with other large-scale terrorist attacks , conspiracy theories dispute
        the official claims and allege the involvement of additional perpetrators.
      - As a result of the bombing, the U.S. government passed the Antiterrorism and
        Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 , which tightened the standards for habeas
        corpus in the United States , as well as legislation designed to increase
        the protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks.
      - On April 19, 2000, the Oklahoma City National Memorial was dedicated on the
        site of the Murrah Federal Building, commemorating the victims of the bombing.
      - Annual remembrance services are held at the same time of day as the original
        explosion occurred.

      - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in the Solar
        System .
      - It is a gas giant with mass one-thousandth that of the Sun but is two and
        a half times the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System combined.
      - Jupiter is classified as a gas giant along with Saturn , Uranus and Neptune
        .
      - Together, these four planets are sometimes referred to as the or outer planets.
      - The planet was known by astronomers of ancient times, and was associated with
        the mythology and religious beliefs of many cultures.
      - The Romans named the planet after the Roman god Jupiter .
      - When viewed from Earth , Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of −2.94,
        making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the
        Moon and Venus .
      - ( Mars can briefly match Jupiter's brightness at certain points in its orbit.)
      - Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being
        helium , although helium only comprises about a tenth of the number of molecules.
      - It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other gas
        giants, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface.
      - Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid
        (it possesses a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator).
      - The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different
        latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries.
      - A prominent result is the Great Red Spot , a giant storm that is known to
        have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope
        .
      - Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere
        .
      - There are also at least 67 moons, including the four large moons called the
        Galilean moons that were first discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610.
      - Ganymede , the largest of these moons, has a diameter greater than that of
        the planet Mercury .
      - Jupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft , most
        notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions and later by the
        Galileo orbiter .
      - The most recent probe to visit Jupiter was the Pluto -bound New Horizons spacecraft
        in late February 2007.
      - The probe used the gravity from Jupiter to increase its speed.
      - Future targets for exploration in the Jovian system include the possible ice-covered

      - The Late Heavy Bombardment (commonly referred to as the lunar cataclysm, or
        LHB) is a hypothetical event around 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago ( Ga ).
      - During this event a very large number of the impact craters on the Moon would
        have formed, and by inference on Earth , Mercury , Venus and Mars as well.
      - (While the LHB is "late" in the Solar System's accretion period when Earth
        and the other rocky planets formed and gained most of their mass, it is early
        in Solar System history.)
      - The evidence for this event comes primarily from the dating of lunar samples
        brought back by the Apollo astronauts, which indicates that most impact melt
        rocks formed in this rather narrow interval of time.
      - While many hypotheses have been put forth to explain a spike in the flux of
        asteroids or comets in the inner Solar System at this time, no consensus yet
        exists as to its cause.
      - The Nice model , popular among planetary scientists , postulates that the
        gas giant planets underwent orbital migration and forced objects in the asteroid
        belt and/or Kuiper belt on eccentric orbits that put them in the path of the
        terrestrial planets .
      - Nevertheless, some researchers argue that the lunar sample data do not require
        a cataclysmic cratering event near 3.9 Ga, and that the apparent clustering
        of impact melt ages near this time is an artifact of sampling material affected
        by a single large impact basin.

      - The Federal Reserve System (also known as the Federal Reserve, and informally
        as the Fed) is the central banking system of the United States.
      - It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the Federal Reserve
        Act , largely in response to a series of financial panics, particularly a
        severe panic in 1907 .
      - Over time, the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System have
        expanded and its structure has evolved.
      - Events such as the Great Depression were major factors leading to changes
        in the system.
      - 'The US Congress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the
        Federal Reserve Act: Maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term
        interest rates.'
      - The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve's
        dual mandate.
      - Its duties have expanded over the years, and today, according to official
        Federal Reserve documentation, include conducting the nation's monetary policy
        , supervising and regulating banking institutions, maintaining the stability
        of the financial system and providing financial services to depository institutions
        , the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions.
      - The Fed also conducts research into the economy and releases numerous publications,
        such as the Beige Book .
      - The Federal Reserve System's structure is composed of the presidentially appointed
        Board of Governors (or Federal Reserve Board), the Federal Open Market Committee
        (FOMC), twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks located in major cities throughout
        the nation, numerous privately owned U.S. member banks and various advisory
        councils.
      - The FOMC is the committee responsible for setting monetary policy and consists
        of all seven members of the Board of Governors and the twelve regional bank
        presidents, though only five bank presidents vote at any given time (the president
        of the New York Fed and four others who rotate through one-year terms).
      - It is also unusual in that an entity outside of the central bank, namely the
        United States Department of the Treasury , creates the currency used.
      - According to the Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve System "is considered
        an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have
        to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative
        branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress,
        and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential
        and congressional terms."
      - The authority of the Federal Reserve System is derived from statutes enacted
        by the U.S. Congress and the System is subject to congressional oversight.
      - The members of the Board of Governors, including its chairman and vice-chairman,
        are chosen by the President and confirmed by the Senate.
      - The government also exercises some control over the Federal Reserve by appointing
        and setting the salaries of the system's highest-level employees.
      - Nationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in the Federal
        Reserve Bank of their region; this entitles them to elect some of the members
        of the board of the regional Federal Reserve Bank.
      - Thus the Federal Reserve system has both public and private aspects.
      - The U.S. Government receives all of the system's annual profits, after a statutory
        dividend of 6% on member banks' capital investment is paid, and an account
        surplus is maintained.
      - In 2010, the Federal Reserve made a profit of $82 billion and transferred
        $79 billion to the U.S. Treasury .
      - This was followed at the end of 2011 with a transfer of $77 billion in profits
        to the U.S. Treasury Department.

      - The word " sea " is often used interchangeably with "ocean", but strictly
        speaking a sea is a body of saline water (possibly a division of the World
        Ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.
      - Earth is the only planet known to have an ocean (or any large amounts of open
        liquid water).
      - Approximately 72% of the planet's surface (~3.6x108 km2) is covered by saline
        water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller
        seas, with the ocean covering approximately 71% of the Earth's surface.
      - In terms of the hydrosphere of the Earth, the ocean contains 97% of the Earth's
        water.
      - Oceanographers have stated that out of 97%, only 5% of the ocean as a whole
        on Earth has been explored.
      - The origin of Earth's oceans is still unknown, but oceans are believed to
        have formed in the Hadean period and may have been the impetus for the emergence
        of life .
      - Extraterrestrial oceans may be composed of a wide range of elements and compounds

        large water oceans.
      - The Mars ocean hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the surface of Mars
        was once covered by water, though the water on Mars is no longer oceanic,
        and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled away the global ocean of Venus.
      - Compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing
        point, so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments
