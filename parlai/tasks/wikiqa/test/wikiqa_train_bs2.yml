      - Heavy metal (often referred to as metal) is a genre of rock music that developed
        in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and in the
        United States.
      - With roots in blues rock and psychedelic rock , the bands that created heavy
        metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified
        distortion , extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness.
      - Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are generally associated with masculinity
        and machismo .
      - The first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin , Deep Purple and Black Sabbath
        attracted large audiences, though they were often derided by critics, a status
        common throughout the history of the genre.
      - In the mid-1970s Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding
        much of its blues influence; Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility
        and an increasing emphasis on speed.
      - Bands in the New Wave of British Heavy Metal such as Iron Maiden followed
        in a similar vein.
      - Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as " metalheads
        " or " headbangers ".
      - During the 1980s, glam metal became a commercial force with groups like Mötley
        Crüe and Poison .
      - 'Underground scenes produced an array of more extreme, aggressive styles:
        thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica , Megadeth
        , Slayer , and Anthrax , while other styles of the most extreme subgenres
        of metal like death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena.'
      - Since the mid-1990s, popular styles such as nu metal , which often incorporates
        elements of grunge and hip hop ; and metalcore , which blends extreme metal
        with hardcore punk , have further expanded the definition of the genre.

      - 'Assassination attempts and plots on Presidents of the United States have
        been numerous: more than 20 attempts to kill sitting and former presidents,
        as well as the Presidents-elect , are known.'
      - 'Four sitting presidents have been killed: Abraham Lincoln (the 16th President),
        James A. Garfield (the 20th President), William McKinley (the 25th President)
        and John F. Kennedy (the 35th President).'
      - 'Two presidents were injured in attempted assassinations: former President
        Theodore Roosevelt (the 26th President), and President Ronald Reagan (the
        40th President).'
      - Although the historian J.W. Clarke has suggested that most American assassinations
        were politically motivated actions, carried out by rational men, not all such
        attacks have been undertaken for political reasons.
      - Some attackers had questionable mental stability, and a few were judged legally
        insane.
      - Since the Vice President of the United States has for more than a century
        been elected from the same political party as the President, the assassination
        of the President is unlikely to result in major policy changes.
      - This may explain why political groups typically do not make such attacks.

      - Gaius Julius Caesar (, July 100 BC – 15 March 44 BC) was a Roman general ,
        statesman , Consul and notable author of Latin prose.
      - He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman
        Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire .
      - In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed a political alliance that was
        to dominate Roman politics for several years.
      - Their attempts to amass power through populist tactics were opposed by the
        conservative elite within the Roman Senate , among them Cato the Younger with
        the frequent support of Cicero .
      - Caesar's conquest of Gaul , completed by 51 BC, extended Rome's territory
        to the English Channel and the Rhine .
      - Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both when he built a bridge
        across the Rhine and conducted the first invasion of Britain .
      - These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to
        eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate
        after the death of Crassus in 53 BC.
      - With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to lay down his
        military command and return to Rome.
      - Caesar refused, and marked his defiance in 49 BC by crossing the Rubicon with
        a legion , leaving his province and illegally entering Roman territory under
        arms.
      - Civil war resulted, from which he emerged as the unrivaled leader of Rome.
      - After assuming control of government, Caesar began a program of social and
        governmental reforms, including the creation of the Julian calendar .
      - He centralised the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed
        "dictator in perpetuity".
      - But the underlying political conflicts had not been resolved, and on the Ides
        of March (15 March) 44 BC, Caesar was assassinated by a group of senators
        led by Marcus Junius Brutus .
      - A new series of civil wars broke out, and the constitutional government of
        the Republic was never restored.
      - Caesar's adopted heir Octavian, later known as Augustus , rose to sole power,
        and the era of the Roman Empire began.
      - Much of Caesar's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns,
        and from other contemporary sources, mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero
        and the historical writings of Sallust .
      - The later biographies of Caesar by Suetonius and Plutarch are also major sources.
      - Caesar is deemed to be one of the greatest military commanders of history
        .

      - Schizophrenia ( or ) is a mental disorder characterized by a breakdown of
        thought processes and by a deficit of typical emotional responses.
      - Common symptoms include auditory hallucinations , paranoid or bizarre delusions
        , or disorganized speech and thinking , and it is accompanied by significant
        social or occupational dysfunction.
      - The onset of symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood, with a global lifetime
        prevalence of about 0.3–0.7%.
      - Diagnosis is based on observed behavior and the patient's reported experiences.
      - Genetics , early environment, neurobiology , and psychological and social
        processes appear to be important contributory factors; some recreational and
        prescription drugs appear to cause or worsen symptoms.
      - Current research is focused on the role of neurobiology, although no single
        isolated organic cause has been found.
      - The many possible combinations of symptoms have triggered debate about whether
        the diagnosis represents a single disorder or a number of discrete syndromes.
      - Despite the etymology of the term from the Greek roots skhizein (σχίζειν,
        "to split") and phrēn, phren- (φρήν, φρεν-; "mind"), schizophrenia does not
        imply a "split personality", or "multiple personality disorder" (which is
        known these days as dissociative identity disorder )—a condition with which
        it is often confused in public perception.
      - Rather, the term means a "splitting of mental functions", because of the symptomatic
        presentation of the illness.
      - The mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication, which primarily suppresses
        dopamine (and sometimes serotonin ) receptor activity.
      - Psychotherapy and vocational and social rehabilitation are also important
        in treatment.
      - In more serious cases—where there is risk to self and others— involuntary
        hospitalization may be necessary, although hospital stays are now shorter
        and less frequent than they once were.
      - The disorder is thought mainly to affect cognition , but it also usually contributes
        to chronic problems with behavior and emotion.
      - People with schizophrenia are likely to have additional ( comorbid ) conditions,
        including major depression and anxiety disorders ; the lifetime occurrence
        of substance use disorder is almost 50%.
      - Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty, and homelessness
        are common.
      - The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is 12 to 15 years
        less than those without, the result of increased physical health problems
        and a higher suicide rate (about 5%).

      - RFID chip next to a grain of rice.
      - This chip contains a radio-frequency electromagnetic field coil that modulates
        an external magnetic field to transfer a coded identification number when
        queried by a reader device.
      - This small type is incorporated in consumer products, and implanted in pets,
        for identification purposes.
      - Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the wireless non-contact use of radio-frequency
        electromagnetic fields to transfer data, for the purposes of automatically
        identifying and tracking tags attached to objects.
      - The tags contain electronically stored information.
      - Some tags are powered and read at short ranges (a few meters) via magnetic
        fields ( electromagnetic induction ).
      - Others use a local power source such as a battery, or else have no battery
        but collect energy from the interrogating EM field, and then act as a passive
        transponder to emit microwaves or UHF radio waves (i.e., electromagnetic radiation
        at high frequencies).
      - Battery powered tags may operate at hundreds of meters.
      - Unlike a bar code , the tag does not necessarily need to be within line of
        sight of the reader, and may be embedded in the tracked object.
      - RFID tags are used in many industries.
      - An RFID tag attached to an automobile during production can be used to track
        its progress through the assembly line.
      - Pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses.
      - Livestock and pets may have tags injected , allowing positive identification
        of the animal.
      - Since RFID tags can be attached to clothing, possessions, or even implanted
        within people , the possibility of reading personally-linked information without
        consent has raised privacy concerns.
