        But , son , I am angry that thou shouldst meddle in the business that belongs
        to these dirty Assamese jungle folk .

        Kala Nag will obey none but me , so I must go with him into the Keddah , but
        he is only a fighting elephant , and he does not help to rope them .

        So I sit at my ease , as befits a mahout , -- not a mere hunter , -- a mahout
        , I say , and a man who gets a pension at the end of his service .

        Is the family of Toomai of the Elephants to be trodden underfoot in the dirt
        of a Keddah ?

        Bad one !

        Wicked one !

        Worthless son !

        Go and wash Kala Nag and attend to his ears , and see that there are no thorns
        in his feet .

        Or else Petersen Sahib will surely catch thee and make thee a wild hunter
        -- a follower of elephant ''s foot tracks , a jungle bear .

        Bah !

        Shame !

        Go ! ''''

        Little Toomai went off without saying a word , but he told Kala Nag all his
        grievances while he was examining his feet .

        `` No matter , '''' said Little Toomai , turning up the fringe of Kala Nag
        ''s huge right ear .

        `` They have said my name to Petersen Sahib , and perhaps -- and perhaps --
        and perhaps -- who knows ?

        Hai !

        That is a big thorn that I have pulled out ! ''''

        The next few days were spent in getting the elephants together , in walking
        the newly caught wild elephants up and down between a couple of tame ones
        to prevent them giving too much trouble on the downward march to the plains
        , and in taking stock of the blankets and ropes and things that had been worn
        out or lost in the forest .

        Petersen Sahib came in on his clever she-elephant Pudmini ; he had been paying
        off other camps among the hills , for the season was coming to an end , and
        there was a native clerk sitting at a table under a tree , to pay the drivers
        their wages .

        As each man was paid he went back to his elephant , and joined the line that
        stood ready to start .

        The catchers , and hunters , and beaters , the men of the regular XXXXX ,
        who stayed in the jungle year in and year out , sat on the backs of the elephants
        that belonged to Petersen Sahib ''s permanent force , or leaned against the
        trees with their guns across their arms , and made fun of the drivers who
        were going away , and laughed when the newly caught elephants broke the line
        and ran about .'

        ` This is not common wood , '' answered the other .

        ` What sort of wood is it , then ? ''

        said the Simpleton .

        ` If you throw it upon the ground , '' said the man , ` it will be changed
        into an army of soldiers . ''

        ` Come into the ship with us , then . ''

        And so he too joined them ; and away the ship flew on , and on , and on ,
        and once more the Simpleton looked out , and this time he saw a man carrying
        straw upon his back .

        ` Hallo !

        Where are you carrying that straw to ? ''

        ` To the village , '' said the man .

        ` Do you mean to say there is no straw in the village ? ''

        ` Ah !

        but this is quite a peculiar straw .

        If you strew it about even in the hottest summer the air at once becomes cold
        , and snow falls , and the people freeze . ''

        Then the Simpleton asked him also to join them .

        At last the ship , with its strange crew , arrived at the King ''s Court .

        The King was having his dinner , but he at once despatched one of his courtiers
        to find out what the huge , strange new bird could be that had come flying
        through the air .

        The courtier peeped into the ship , and , seeing what it was , instantly went
        back to the King and told him that it was a flying ship , and that it was
        manned by a few peasants .

        Then the King remembered his royal oath ; but he made up his mind that he
        would never consent to let the Princess marry a poor peasant .

        So he thought and thought , and then said to himself : '' I will give him
        some impossible tasks to perform ; that will be the best way of getting rid
        of him . ''

        And he there and then decided to despatch one of his courtiers to the Simpleton
        , with the command that he was to fetch the King the healing water from the
        world ''s end before he had finished his dinner .

        But while the XXXXX was still instructing the courtier exactly what he was
        to say , the first man of the ship ''s company , the one with the miraculous
        power of hearing , had overheard the King ''s words , and hastily reported
        them to the poor Simpleton .'

        ` But where is he to find the Witch-maiden ? ''

        said the first bird .

        ` She has no settled dwelling , but is here to-day and gone to-morrow .

        He might as well try to catch the wind . ''

        The other replied , '' I do not know , certainly , where she is at present
        , but in three nights from now she will come to the spring to wash her face
        , as she does every month when the moon is full , in order that she may never
        grow old nor wrinkled , but may always keep the bloom of youth . ''

        ` Well , '' said the first bird , ` the spring is not far from here .

        Shall we go and see how it is she does it ? ''

        ` Willingly , if you like , '' said the other .

        The youth immediately resolved to follow the birds to the spring , only two
        things made him uneasy : first , lest he might be asleep when the birds went
        , and secondly , lest he might lose sight of them , since he had not wings
        to carry him along so swiftly .

        He was too tired to keep awake all night , yet his anxiety prevented him from
        sleeping soundly , and when with the earliest dawn he looked up to the tree-top
        , he was glad to see his feathered companions still asleep with their heads
        under their wings .

        He ate his breakfast , and waited until the birds should start , but they
        did not leave the place all day .

        They hopped about from one tree to another looking for food , all day long
        until the evening , when they went back to their old perch to sleep .

        The next day the same thing happened , but on the third morning one bird said
        to the other , ` To-day we must go to the spring to see the Witch-maiden wash
        her face . ''

        They remained on the tree till noon ; then they flew away and went towards
        the south .

        The young man ''s heart beat with anxiety lest he should lose sight of his
        guides , but he managed to keep the birds in view until they again perched
        upon a tree .

        The young man ran after them until he was quite exhausted and out of breath
        , and after three short rests the birds at length reached a small open space
        in the forest , on the edge of which they placed themselves on the top of
        a high tree .

        When the youth had overtaken them , he saw that there was a clear spring in
        the middle of the space .

        He sat down at the foot of the tree upon which the birds were perched , and
        listened attentively to what they were saying to each other .

        ` The sun is not down yet , '' said the first bird ; ` we must wait yet awhile
        till the moon rises and the maiden comes to the spring .

        Do you think she will see that young XXXXX sitting under the tree ? '''

        When she got home she shut herself up in her room and cried .

        There was nothing for her to do but resign , she thought dismally .

        On the following Saturday Esther went for an afternoon walk , carrying her
        kodak with her .

        It was a brilliantly fine autumn day , and woods and fields were basking in
        a mellow haze .

        Esther went across lots to Mrs. Charley Cropper ''s house , intending to make
        a call .

        But the house was locked up and evidently deserted , so she rambled past it
        to the back fields .

        Passing through a grove of maples she came out among leafy young saplings
        on the other side .

        Just beyond her , with its laden boughs hanging over the line fence , was
        the famous plum tree .

        Esther looked at it for a moment .

        Then an odd smile gleamed over her face and she lifted her kodak .

        Monday evening Esther called on Mr. Cropper again .

        After the preliminary remarks in which he indulged , she said , with seeming
        irrelevance , that Saturday had been a fine day .

        `` There was an excellent light for snapshots , '''' she went on coolly .

        `` I went out with my kodak and was lucky enough to get a good negative .

        I have brought you up a proof .

        I thought you would be interested in it . ''''

        She rose and placed the proof on the table before Mr. Cropper .

        The plum tree came out clearly .

        Bob and Alf Cropper were up among the boughs picking the plums .

        On the ground beneath them stood their father with a basket of fruit in his
        hand .

        Mr. Cropper looked at the XXXXX and from it to Esther .'

        Longman , the third , looked at the others over his shoulder .

        Goldband , the fourth , had a gold sash round his waist ; and little Playman
        did nothing at all , and was the more proud .

        There was too much ostentation , and so I came away . ''

        ` And now we are sitting and shining here ! ''

        But he did not lose courage , and ran back to the stream with his pitcher
        , filled it once more with water , and was home ten minutes before the King
        ''s daughter arrived .

        ` Look , '' said he , '' I have only just exercised my legs ; that was nothing
        of a run . ''

        But the King was angry , and his daughter even more so , that she should be
        carried away by a common , discharged soldier .

        They consulted together how they could destroy both him and his companions
        .

        ` Then , '' said the King to her , '' I have found a way .

        Do n''t be frightened ; they shall not come home again . ''

        He said to them , ` You must now make merry together , and eat and drink ,
        '' and he led them into a room which had a floor of iron ; the doors were
        also of iron , and the windows were barred with iron .

        In the room was a table spread with delicious food .

        The King said to them , ` Go in and enjoy yourselves , '' and as soon as they
        were inside he had the doors shut and bolted .

        Then he made the cook come , and ordered him to keep up a large fire under
        the room until the iron was red-hot .

        The cook did so , and the Six sitting round the table felt it grow very warm
        , and they thought this was because of their good fare ; but when the heat
        became still greater and they wanted to go out , but found the doors and windows
        fastened , then they knew that the King meant them harm and was trying to
        suffocate them .

        ` But he shall not succeed , '' cried he of the little hat , '' I will make
        a frost come which shall make the fire ashamed and die out ! ''

        So he put his hat on straight , and at once there came such a frost that all
        the heat disappeared and the food on the dishes began to freeze .

        When a couple of hours had passed , and the King thought they must be quite
        dead from the heat , he had the doors opened and went in himself to see .

        But when the doors were opened , there stood all Six , alive and well , saying
        they were glad they could come out to warm themselves , for the great cold
        in the room had frozen all the food hard in the dishes .

        Then the King went angrily to the cook , and scolded him , and asked him why
        he had not done what he was told .

        But the cook answered , ` There is heat enough there ; see for yourself .
        ''

        Then the King saw a huge fire burning under the iron room , and understood
        that he could do no harm to the Six in this way .

        The King now began again to think how he could free himself from his unwelcome
        guests .

        He commanded the master to come before him , and said , ` If you will take
        gold , and give up your right to my daughter , you shall have as much as you

        Then it dawned on the Prince that he had been speaking to a good fairy , and
        putting the little bell carefully in his pocket , he rode home and told his
        father that he meant to set the daughter of the Flower Queen free , and intended
        setting out on the following day into the wide world in search of the maid
        .

        So the next morning the Prince mounted his fine horse and left his home .

        He had roamed round the world for a whole year , and his horse had died of
        exhaustion , while he himself had suffered much from want and misery , but
        still he had come on no trace of her he was in search of .

        At last one day he came to a hut , in front of which sat a very old man .

        The Prince asked him , ` Do you not know where the Dragon lives who keeps
        the daughter of the Flower Queen prisoner ? ''

        ` No , I do not , '' answered the old man .

        ` But if you go straight along this road for a XXXXX , you will reach a hut
        where my father lives , and possibly he may be able to tell you . '''

        In this way you will be able to get through the wood unhurt . ''

        Iwanich thanked the old man for his counsel , dismounted from his horse ,
        and , taking the bag and the hare in his arms , he entered the forest .

        He had hardly lost sight of his gaunt grey friend when he heard growls and
        snarls in the thicket close to him , and before he had time to think he found
        himself surrounded by the most dreadful-looking creatures .

        On one side he saw the glittering eye of a cruel tiger , on the other the
        gleaming teeth of a great she-wolf ; here a huge bear growled fiercely , and
        there a horrible snake coiled itself in the grass at his feet .

        But Iwanich did not forget the old man ''s advice , and quickly put his hand
        into the bag and took out as many bread-crumbs as he could hold in his hand
        at a time .

        He threw them to the beasts , but soon the bag grew lighter and lighter ,
        and the Prince began to feel a little frightened .

        And now the last crumb was gone , and the hungry beasts thronged round him
        , greedy for fresh prey .

        Then he seized the hare and threw it to them .

        No sooner did the little creature feel itself on the ground than it lay back
        its ears and flew through the wood like an arrow from a bow , closely pursued
        by the wild beasts , and the Prince was left alone .

        He looked at his ring , and when he saw that it sparkled as brightly as ever
        he went straight on through the forest .

        He had n''t gone very far when he saw a most extraordinary looking man coming
        towards him .

        He was not more than three feet high , his legs were quite crooked , and all
        his body was covered with prickles like a hedgehog .

        Two lions walked with him , fastened to his side by the two ends of his long
        beard .

        He stopped the Prince and asked him in a harsh voice : ` Are you the man who
        has just fed my body-guard ? ''

        Iwanich was so startled that he could hardly reply , but the little man continued
        : '' I am most grateful to you for your kindness ; what can I give you as
        a reward ? ''

        ` All I ask , '' replied Iwanich , ` is , that I should be allowed to go through
        this wood in safety . ''

        ` Most certainly , '' answered the little man ; ` and for greater security
        I will give you one of my lions as a protector .

        But when you leave this wood and come near a palace which does not belong
        to my domain , let the lion go , in order that he may not fall into the hands
        of an enemy and be killed . ''

        With these words he loosened the lion from his beard and bade the beast guard
        the youth carefully .

        With this new protector Iwanich wandered on through the forest , and though
        he came upon a great many more wolves , hyenas , leopards , and other wild
        beasts , they always kept at a respectful distance when they saw what sort
        of an escort the Prince had with him .

        XXXXX hurried through the wood as quickly as his legs would carry him , but
        , nevertheless , hour after hour went by and not a trace of a green field
        or a human habitation met his eyes .'
