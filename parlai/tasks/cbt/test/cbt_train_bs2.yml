        The Queen kissed her , and said : `` Well , to please you , let me see what
        I can do for this cross Bruno . ''''

        And with a wave of her wand she turned the poor little cottage into a splendid
        palace , full of treasures ; only the two stools and the straw bed remained
        just as they were , to remind him of his former poverty .

        Then the Queen touched Bruno himself , and made him gentle and polite and
        grateful , and he thanked her and the Princess a thousand times .

        Lastly , the Queen restored the hen and the cabbages to their natural forms
        , and left them all very contented .

        The Prince and Princess were married as soon as possible with great splendor
        , and lived happily ever after .

        -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- Fortunee .

        Par Madame la Comtesse d''Aulnoy .

        THE WHITE CAT Once upon a time there was a king who had three sons , who were
        all so clever and brave that he began to be afraid that they would want to
        reign over the kingdom before he was dead .

        Now the King , though he felt that he was growing old , did not at all wish
        to give up the government of his kingdom while he could still manage it very
        well , so he thought the best way to live in peace would be to divert the
        minds of his sons by promises which he could always get out of when the time
        came for keeping them .

        So he sent for them all , and , after speaking to them kindly , he added :
        `` You will quite agree with me , my dear children , that my great age makes
        it impossible for me to look after my affairs of state as carefully as I once
        did .

        I begin to fear that this may affect the welfare of my subjects , therefore
        I wish that one of you should succeed to my crown ; but in return for such
        a gift as this it is only right that you should do something for me .

        Now , as I think of retiring into the country , it seems to me that a pretty
        , lively , faithful little dog would be very good company for me ; so , without
        any regard for your ages , I promise that the one who brings me the most beautiful
        little dog shall succeed me at once . ''''

        The three Princes were greatly surprised by their father ''s sudden fancy
        for a little dog , but as it gave the two younger ones a chance they would
        not otherwise have had of being king , and as the eldest was too polite to
        make any objection , they accepted the commission with pleasure .

        They bade farewell to the King , who gave them presents of silver and precious
        stones , and appointed to meet them at the same hour , in the same place ,
        after a year had passed , to see the little dogs they had brought for him
        .

        Then they went together to a castle which was about a league from the city
        , accompanied by all their particular friends , to whom they gave a grand
        banquet , and the three brothers promised to be friends always , to share
        whatever good fortune befell them , and not to be parted by any envy or jealousy
        ; and so they set out , agreeing to meet at the same castle at the appointed
        time , to present themselves before the King together .

        Each one took a different road , and the two eldest met with many adventures
        ; but it is about the youngest that you are going to hear .

        He was young , and gay , and handsome , and knew everything that a prince
        ought to know ; and as for his courage , there was simply no end to it .

        Hardly a day passed without his buying several dogs -- big and little , greyhounds
        , mastiffs , spaniels , and lapdogs .

        As soon as he had bought a pretty one he was sure to see a still prettier
        , and then he had to get rid of all the others and buy that one , as , being
        alone , he found it impossible to take thirty or forty thousand dogs about
        with him .

        He journeyed from day to day , not knowing where he was going , until at last
        , just at nightfall , he reached a great , gloomy forest .

        He did not know his way , and , to make matters worse , it XXXXX to thunder
        , and the rain poured down .'

        He was as much merrier than you , for instance , as you are merrier than your
        father .

        Sometimes he fell , like a spinning-top , from sheer merriment .

        Have you seen a greyhound leaping the fences of the Gardens ?

        That is how Peter leaps them .

        Gentlemen who walk home at night write to the papers to say they heard a nightingale
        in the Gardens , but it is really Peter ''s pipe they hear .

        Of course , he had no mother -- at least , what use was she to him ?

        You can be sorry for him for that , but do n''t be too sorry , for the next
        thing I mean to tell you is how he revisited her .

        It was the fairies who gave him the chance .

        -LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` The Thrush ''s Nest '' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration
        : Headpiece to ` Lock-out Time '' -RSB- IV LOCK-OUT TIME It is frightfully
        difficult to know much about the fairies , and almost the only thing known
        for certain is that there are fairies wherever there are children .

        Long ago children were forbidden the Gardens , and at that time there was
        not a fairy in the place ; then the children were admitted , and the fairies
        came trooping in that very evening .

        They ca n''t resist following the children , but you seldom see them , partly
        because they live in the daytime behind the railings , where you are not allowed
        to go , and also partly because they are so cunning .

        They are not a bit cunning after Lock-out , but until Lock-out , my word !

        pity you ca n''t write down , for gradually you forget , and I have heard
        of children who declared that they had never once seen a fairy .

        Very likely if they said this in the Kensington Gardens , they were standing
        looking at a fairy all the time .

        The reason they were cheated was that she pretended to be something else .

        This is one of their best tricks .

        They usually pretend to be flowers , because the court sits in the Fairies
        '' Basin , and there are so many flowers there , and all along the Baby Walk
        , that a flower is the thing least likely to attract attention .

        They dress exactly like flowers , and change with the seasons , putting on
        white when lilies are in and blue for bluebells , and so on .

        They like crocus and hyacinth time best of all , as they are partial to a
        bit of colour , but tulips -LRB- except white ones , which are the fairy cradles
        -RRB- they consider garish , and they sometimes put off dressing like tulips
        for days , so that the beginning of the tulip weeks is almost the best time
        to catch them .

        you look , and they fear there is no time to hide , they stand quite still

        In the first place , he had seen old Granny Fox and Reddy Fox hanging about
        a little way off , and though they had disappeared after a while , Danny had
        an idea that they were not far away , but were hiding so that they might catch
        him on his way home .

        Of course , he had n''t the slightest intention of giving them the chance
        .

        He had made up his mind to ask Peter if he might spend the night in a corner
        of the Old Briar-patch , and he was very sure that Peter would say he might
        , for he and Peter are very good friends , very good friends indeed .

        The second good reason Danny had for waiting was this very friendship .

        You see , Peter had been away from the Green Meadows so long that Danny felt
        sure he could n''t know all about how things were there now , and so he wanted
        to warn Peter that the Green Meadows were not nearly as safe as before Old
        Man Coyote had come there to live .

        So Danny waited , and when all the rest of the callers had left he called
        Peter to one side where little Mrs. Peter could n''t hear .

        Danny stood up on his hind legs so as to whisper in one of Peter ''s ears
        .

        `` Do you know that Old Man Coyote is the most dangerous enemy we have , Peter

        that he always paid his debts .

        Danny Meadow Mouse looked doubtful .

        ` You have guessed right , '' replied Lyma .

        The mother of the Stalos looked round for her iron cane , which she always
        used to kill her victims , but it was not there , for Lyma had put it in the
        fire .

        ` Where is my iron cane ? ''

        asked the old woman .

        ` There ! ''

        answered Lyma , pointing to the flames .

        The old woman sprang forwards and seized it , but her clothes caught fire
        , and in a few minutes she was burned to ashes .

        So the Sodno brothers found the treasure , and they carried it , and their
        sister and the reindeer , to their own home , and were the richest men in
        all Lapland .

        Andras Baive -LSB- From Lapplandische Marchen , J. C. Poestion . -RSB-

        Once upon a time there lived in Lapland a man who was so very strong and swift
        of foot that nobody in his native town of Vadso could come near him if they
        were running races in the summer evenings .

        The people of Vadso were very proud of their champion , and thought that there
        was no one like him in the world , till , by-and-by , it came to their ears
        that there dwelt among the mountains a Lapp , Andras Baive by name , who was
        said by his friends to be even stronger and swifter than the bailiff .

        Of course not a creature in Vadso believed that , and declared that if it
        made the mountaineers happier to talk such nonsense , why , let them !

        The winter was long and cold , and the thoughts of the villagers were much
        busier with wolves than with Andras Baive , when suddenly , on a frosty day
        , he made his appearance in the little town of Vadso .

        The bailiff was delighted at this chance of trying his strength , and at once
        went out to seek Andras and to coax him into giving proof of his vigour .

        As he walked along his eyes fell upon a big eight-oared boat that lay upon
        the shore , and his face shone with pleasure .

        ` That is the very thing , '' laughed he , '' I will make him jump over that
        boat . ''

        Andras was quite ready to accept the challenge , and they soon settled the
        terms of the wager .

        He who could jump over the boat without so much as touching it with his heel
        was to be the winner , and would get a large sum of money as the prize .

        So , followed by many of the villagers , the two men walked down to the sea
        .

        An old fisherman was chosen to stand near the boat to watch fair play , and
        to hold the stakes , and Andras , as the stranger was told to jump first .

        Going back to the flag which had been stuck into the sand to mark the starting
        place , he ran forward , XXXXX his head well thrown back , and cleared the
        boat with a mighty bound .'

        On entering the cave they saw all the bags laid ready , and could not imagine
        how anyone had got in without knowing their secret .

        They cut Cassim ''s body into four quarters , and nailed them up inside the
        cave , in order to frighten anyone who should venture in , and went away in
        search of more treasure .

        As night drew on Cassim ''s wife grew very uneasy , and ran to her brother-in-law
        , and told him where her husband had gone .

        Ali Baba did his best to comfort her , and set out to the forest in search
        of Cassim .

        The first thing he saw on entering the cave was his dead brother .

        Full of horror , he put the body on one of his asses , and bags of gold on
        the other two , and , covering all with some fagots , returned home .

        He drove the two asses laden with gold into his own yard , and led the other
        to Cassim ''s house .

        The door was opened by the slave Morgiana , whom he knew to be both brave
        and cunning .

        Unloading the ass , he said to her : `` This is the body of your master ,
        who has been murdered , but whom we must bury as though he had died in his
        bed .

        I will speak with you again , but now tell your mistress I am come . ''''

        The wife of Cassim , on learning the fate of her husband , broke out into
        cries and tears , but Ali Baba offered to take her to live with him and his
        wife if she would promise to keep his counsel and leave everything to Morgiana
        ; whereupon she agreed , and dried her eyes .

        Morgiana , meanwhile , sought an apothecary and asked him for some lozenges
        .

        `` My poor master , '''' she said , `` can neither eat nor speak , and no
        one knows what his distemper is . ''''

        She carried home the lozenges and returned next day weeping , and asked for
        an essence only given to those just about to die .

        Thus , in the evening , no one was surprised to hear the wretched shrieks
        and cries of Cassim ''s wife and Morgiana , telling everyone that Cassim was
        dead .

        The day after Morgiana went to an old cobbler near the gates of the town who
        opened his stall early , put a piece of gold in his hand , and bade him follow
        her with his needle and thread .

        Having bound his eyes with a handkerchief , she took him to the room where
        the body lay , pulled off the bandage , and bade him sew the quarters together
        , after which she covered his eyes again and led him home .

        Then they buried Cassim , and Morgiana his slave followed him to the grave
        , weeping and tearing her hair , while Cassim ''s wife stayed at home uttering
        lamentable cries .

        Next day she went to live with Ali Baba , who gave Cassim ''s shop to his
        eldest son .

        The Forty Thieves , on their return to the cave , were much astonished to
        find Cassim ''s body gone and some of their money-bags .

        Don was out lapping the water as I came by , and I do n''t believe he ''s

        Still , to ease our minds and compose our spirits , and get our guilty faces

        Sit still , Rob ; and Ted , you harness up while I run and get my hat and

        Nan talked on as a vent for the hidden emotions which professional pride would
        not allow her to show , and the boys approved her plan at once ; for action

        Ted went staggering away to wash his face at the pump , and rub some colour
        into his cheeks before he harnessed the horse .

        through some very memorable moments .

        Boy as he was , the thought of death coming suddenly to him , and in this
        way , might well make him sober ; for it is a very solemn thing to be arrested
        in the midst of busy life by the possibility of the great change .

        There were no sins to be repented of , few faults , and many happy , dutiful
        years to remember with infinite comfort .

        So Rob had no fears to daunt him , no regrets to sadden , and best of all
        , a very strong and simple piety to sustain and cheer him .

        ` Mein Vater , '' was his first thought ; for Rob was very near the Professor
        ''s heart , and the loss of his eldest would have been a bitter blow .

        These words , whispered with a tremble of the lips that had been so firm when
        the hot iron burned , recalled that other Father who is always near , always
        tender and helpful ; and , folding his hands , Rob said the heartiest little
        prayer he ever prayed , there on the hay , to the soft twitter of the brooding
        birds .

        It did him good ; and wisely laying all his fear and doubt and trouble in
        God ''s hand , the boy felt ready for whatever was to come , and from that
        hour kept steadily before him the one duty that was plain -- to be brave and
        cheerful , keep silent , and hope for the best .

        Nan stole her hat , and left a note on Daisy ''s pincushion , saying she had
        taken the boys to drive , and all would be out of the way till after tea .

        Then she hurried back and found her patients much better , the one for work
        , the other for rest .

        In they got , and , putting Rob on the back seat with his leg up drove away
        , looking as gay and care-free as if nothing had happened .

        Dr Morrison made light of the affair , but told Nan she had done right ; and
        as the much-relieved lads went downstairs , he added in a whisper : ` Send
        the dog off for a while , and keep your eye on the boy .

        Do n''t let him know it , and report to me if anything seems wrong .

        One never knows in these cases .

        No harm to be careful . ''

        XXXXX nodded , and feeling much relieved now that the responsibility was off
        her shoulders , took the lads to Dr Watkins , who promised to come out later
        and examine Don .'

        So pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered
        .

        `` She is like a white rose ! ''''

        they cried , and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies .

        At the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her .

        He had dreamy violet eyes , and his hair was like fine gold .

        When he saw her he sank upon one knee , and kissed her hand .

        `` Your picture was beautiful , '''' he murmured , `` but you are more beautiful
        than your picture '''' ; and the little Princess blushed .

        `` She was like a white rose before , '''' said a young Page to his neighbour
        , `` but she is like a red rose now '''' ; and the whole Court was delighted
        .

        For the next three days everybody went about saying , `` White rose , Red
        rose , Red rose , White rose '''' ; and the King gave orders that the Page
        ''s salary was to be doubled .

        As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him , but it was
        considered a great honour , and was duly published in the Court Gazette .

        When the three days were over the marriage was celebrated .

        It was a magnificent ceremony , and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in
        hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls .

        Then there was a State Banquet , which lasted for five hours .

        The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of
        a cup of clear crystal .

        Only true lovers could drink out of this cup , for if false lips touched it
        , it grew grey and dull and cloudy .

        `` It ''s quite clear that they love each other , '''' said the little Page
        , `` as clear as crystal ! ''''

        and the King doubled his salary a second time .

        `` What an honour ! ''''

        cried all the courtiers .

        After the banquet there was to be a Ball .

        The bride and bridegroom were to dance the Rose-dance together , and the XXXXX
        had promised to play the flute .'

        `` Now , which will you have ? ''''

        he asked , with a warning look in the honest blue eyes which often unconsciously
        controlled naughty Jill against her will .

        `` That one ! ''''

        and the red mitten pointed firmly to the perilous path just tried .

        `` You will do it ? ''''

        `` I will ! ''''

        `` Come on , then , and hold tight . ''''

        Jack ''s smile was gone now , and he waited without a word while Jill tucked
        herself up , then took his place in front , and off they went on the brief
        , breathless trip straight into the drift by the fence below .

        `` I do n''t see anything very awful in that .

        Come up and have another .

        Joe is watching us , and I ''d like to show him that we are n''t afraid of
        anything , '''' said Jill , with a defiant glance at a distant boy , who had
        paused to watch the descent .

        `` It is a regular ` go-bang , '' if that is what you like , '''' answered
        Jack , as they plowed their way up again .

        `` It is .

        You boys think girls like little mean coasts without any fun or danger in
        them , as if we could n''t be brave and strong as well as you .

        Give me three go-bangs and then we ''ll stop .

        My tumble does n''t count , so give me two more and then I ''ll be good .
        ''''

        Jill took her seat as she spoke , and looked up with such a rosy , pleading
        face that Jack gave in at once , and down they went again , raising a cloud
        of glittering snow-dust as they reined up in fine style with their feet on
        the fence .

        `` It ''s just splendid !

        Now , one more ! ''''

        cried Jill , excited by the cheers of a sleighing party passing below .

        Proud of his skill , XXXXX marched back , resolved to make the third `` go
        '''' the crowning achievement of the afternoon , while Jill pranced after
        him as lightly as if the big boots were the famous seven-leagued ones , and
        chattering about the candy-scrape and whether there would be nuts or not .'

        `` NOW , what does the lean thing do ? ''''

        `` Eat or blow smoke out of his mouth .

        Men always play with their mouths , '''' said Mowgli ; and the silent trailers
        saw the old man fill and light and puff at a water-pipe , and they took good
        note of the smell of the tobacco , so as to be sure of Buldeo in the darkest
        night , if necessary .

        Then a little knot of charcoal-burners came down the path , and naturally
        halted to speak to Buldeo , whose fame as a hunter reached for at least twenty
        miles round .

        They all sat down and smoked , and Bagheera and the others came up and watched
        while Buldeo began to tell the story of Mowgli , the Devil-child , from one
        end to another , with additions and inventions .

        How he himself had really killed Shere Khan ; and how Mowgli had turned himself
        into a wolf , and fought with him all the afternoon , and changed into a boy
        again and bewitched Buldeo ''s rifle , so that the bullet turned the corner
        , when he pointed it at Mowgli , and killed one of Buldeo ''s own buffaloes
        ; and how the village , knowing him to be the bravest hunter in Seeonee ,
        had sent him out to kill this Devil-child .

        But meantime the village had got hold of Messua and her husband , who were
        undoubtedly the father and mother of this Devil-child , and had barricaded
        them in their own hut , and presently would torture them to make them confess
        they were witch and wizard , and then they would be burned to death .

        `` When ? ''''

        said the charcoal-burners , because they would very much like to be present
        at the ceremony .

        Buldeo said that nothing would be done till he returned , because the village
        wished him to kill the Jungle Boy first .

        After that they would dispose of Messua and her husband , and divide their
        lands and buffaloes among the village .

        Messua ''s husband had some remarkably fine buffaloes , too .

        It was an excellent thing to destroy wizards , Buldeo thought ; and people
        who entertained Wolf-children out of the Jungle were clearly the worst kind
        of witches .

        But , said the charcoal-burners , what would happen if the English heard of
        it ?

        The English , they had heard , were a perfectly mad people , who would not
        let honest farmers kill witches in peace .

        Why , said Buldeo , the head-man of the village would report that Messua and
        her husband had died of snake-bite .

        THAT was all arranged , and the only thing now was to kill the Wolf-child
        .

        They did not happen to have seen anything of such a creature ?

        The charcoal-burners looked round cautiously , and thanked their stars they
        had not ; but they had no doubt that so brave a man as Buldeo would find him
        if any one could .

        The sun was getting rather low , and they had an idea that they would push
        on to Buldeo ''s village and see that wicked witch .

        Buldeo said that , though it was his duty to XXXXX the Devil-child , he could
        not think of letting a party of unarmed men go through the Jungle , which
        might produce the Wolf-demon at any minute , without his escort .'
