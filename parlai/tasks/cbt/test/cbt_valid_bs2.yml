        At first she would n''t go without a great deal of coaxing , but after a while
        he did n''t have to coax at all .

        She seemed to delight to be with him as much as he did to be with her .

        So Johnny Chuck grew happier and happier .

        He was happier than he had ever been in all his life before .

        You see Johnny Chuck had found the greatest thing in the world .

        Do you know what it is ?

        It is called love .

        XII JOHNNY CHUCK PROVES HIS LOVE These spring days were beautiful days on
        the Green Meadows .

        It seemed to Johnny Chuck that the Green Meadows never had been so lovely
        or the songs of the birds so sweet .

        He had forgotten all about his old friends , Jimmy Skunk and Peter Rabbit
        and the other little meadow people .

        You see , he could n''t think of anybody but Polly Chuck , and he did n''t
        want to be with anybody but Polly Chuck .

        He had even forgotten that he had started out to see the world .

        He did n''t care anything more about the world .

        All he wanted was to be where Polly Chuck was .

        Then he was perfectly happy .

        That was because Johnny Chuck had found the greatest thing in the world ,
        which is love .

        But Johnny still had one great wish , the wish that he might show Polly Chuck
        just how brave and strong he was and how well he could take care of her .

        One morning they were feasting in a patch of sweet clover over near an old
        stone wall .

        It was the same stone wall in which Johnny Chuck had escaped from old Whitetail
        the Marshhawk , when Johnny was a very little fellow .

        Suddenly Polly gave a little scream of fright .

        Johnny XXXXX looked up to see a dog almost upon her .'

        ` The ogre is coming after us .

        ` But where is he ?

        So Dschemil took the pin from his cloak and threw it behind him , and a dense
        thicket of thorns sprang up round them , which the ogre and his dog could
        not pass through . ''

        So Letiko climbed the tree , and the hares went grazing .

        ` Udea !

        Udea ! ''

        he cried , but she did not move or reply .

        Then he saw that she was dead , and rushed down to his brothers in the courtyard
        and called out , ` Come quickly , our sister is dead ! ''

        In a moment they were all beside her and knew that it was true , and they
        made a bier and laid her on it , and placed her across a camel , and said
        to the camel , ` Take her to her mother , but be careful not to halt by the
        way , and let no man capture you , and see you kneel down before no man ,

        So the camel started , and when it had accomplished half its journey it met
        three men , who ran after it in order to catch it ; but they could not .

        Then they cried ` Stop ! ''

        but the camel only went the faster .

        The three men panted behind till one said to the others , ` Wait a minute
        !

        The string of my sandal is broken ! ''

        The camel caught the word ` string '' and knelt down at once , and the men
        came up and found a dead girl lying on a bier , with a ring on her finger
        .

        And as one of the young men took hold of her hand to pull off the ring , he
        knocked out the man-eater ''s finger-nail , which had stuck there , and the
        maiden sat up and said , ` Let him live who gave me life , and slay him who
        slew me ! ''

        And when the camel heard the maiden speak , it turned and carried her back
        to her brothers .

        Now the brothers were still seated in the court bewailing their sister , and
        their eyes were dim with weeping so that they could hardly see .

        And when the camel stood before them they said , ` Perhaps it has brought
        back our sister ! ''

        and rose to give it a beating .

        But the camel knelt down and the girl dismounted , and they flung themselves
        on her neck and wept more than ever for gladness .

        ` Tell me , '' said the eldest , as soon as he could speak , ` how it all
        came about , and what killed you . '' ''

        I was waiting in the upper chamber , '' said she , ` and a nail of the man-eater

        One day Mrs. Griggs went away from the Dale place with a very curious story
        , which she diligently spread far and wide .

        It made a good deal of talk , but people , although they listened eagerly
        , and wondered and questioned , were rather incredulous about it .

        They thought Mrs. Griggs must be drawing considerably upon her imagination
        ; there were not lacking those who declared that she had invented the whole
        account , since her reputation for strict veracity was not wholly unquestioned
        .

        Mrs. Griggs ''s story was as follows : -- One day she found the door of the
        west gable unlocked .

        She went in , expecting to see bare walls and a collection of odds and ends
        .

        Instead she found herself in a finely furnished room .

        Delicate lace curtains hung before the small , square , broad-silled windows
        .

        The walls were adorned with pictures in much finer taste than Mrs. Griggs
        could appreciate .

        There was a bookcase between the windows filled with choicely bound books
        .

        Beside it stood a little table with a very dainty work-basket on it .

        By the basket Mrs. Griggs saw a pair of tiny scissors and a silver thimble
        .

        A wicker rocker , comfortable with silk cushions , was near it .

        Above the bookcase a woman ''s picture hung -- a water-colour , if Mrs. Griggs
        had but known it -- representing a pale , very sweet face , with large , dark
        eyes and a wistful expression under loose masses of black , lustrous hair
        .

        Just beneath the picture , on the top shelf of the bookcase , was a vaseful
        of flowers .

        Another vaseful stood on the table beside the basket .

        All this was astonishing enough .

        But what puzzled Mrs. Griggs completely was the fact that a woman ''s dress
        was hanging over a chair before the mirror -- a pale blue , silken affair
        .

        And on the floor beside it were two little blue satin slippers !

        Good Mrs. Griggs did not leave the room until she had thoroughly explored
        it , even to shaking out the blue dress and discovering it to be a tea-gown
        -- wrapper , she called it .

        But she found nothing to throw any light on the mystery .

        The fact that the simple name `` Alice '''' was written XXXXX the fly-leaves
        of all the books only deepened it , for it was a name unknown in the Dale
        family .'

        ` When the old man discovered who we were he was beside himself with pleasure
        , and offered us a refuge in the cave where he lived .

        We gladly accepted his offer , and to the cave we all went , taking with us
        the last little pig , which he gave us as a present . ''

        `` The Bassa of the Sea , '''' he added , `` will pay you anything you like
        to ask for it . ''''

        ` Without asking why it was so precious I took the pig and placed it in my
        work bag , where it has been ever since .

        Only yesterday we offered it to the Bassa , who laughed at us , and this so
        enraged us against the dervish that we cut off his beard when he was asleep
        , and now he dare not show himself . ''

        ` Ah , '' exclaimed the page , ` it is not fitting that such beauty should
        waste itself in making other people miserable .

        Forget the unhappy past and think only of the future .

        And accept , I pray you , this watch , to mark the brighter hours in store
        . ''

        So saying he laid the watch upon her knee .

        Then he turned to Tezila .

        ` And you , fair maiden , permit me to offer you this other watch .

        True it is only of silver , but it is all I have left to give .

        And I feel quite sure that you must have somewhere a silver seal , that will
        be exactly the thing to go with it . ''

        ` Why , so you have , '' cried Dely ; ` fasten your silver seal to your watch
        , and I will hang my gold one on to mine . ''

        The seals were produced , and , as Azemi had guessed , they were the talismans
        which the two Circassians had taken from Izif and Izouf , mounted in gold
        and silver .

        As quick as lightning the watches slid from the hands of Tezila and her sister
        , and Aurora and Argentine stood before them , each with her talisman on her
        finger .

        At first they seemed rather confused themselves at the change which had taken
        place , and the sunlight which they had not seen for so long , but when gradually
        they understood that their enchantment had come to an end , they could find
        no words to express their happiness .

        The Circassians could with difficulty be comforted for the loss of the talismans
        , but Aurora and Argentine entreated them to dry their tears , as their father
        , Siroco , who was governor of Alexandria , would not fail to reward them
        in any manner they wished .

        This promise was soon confirmed by Siroco himself , who came into the garden
        with the Bassa and his two sons , and was speedily joined by the ladies of
        the family .

        Only Hassan was absent .

        snapped Sammy Jay .

        `` That ''s for you to find out , '''' replied Johnny Chuck .

        `` There ''s foolish pride and silly pride and pride of low degree ; A better
        pride is honest pride , and that ''s the pride for me . ''''

        And with that , Johnny Chuck disappeared in his new house .

        XX SAMMY JAY UNDERSTANDS It was a beautiful morning .

        Jolly , round , red Mr. Sun had thrown his bedclothes off very early and started
        to climb up the sky , smiling his broadest .

        Old Mother West Wind had swept his path clear of clouds .

        The Merry Little Breezes , who , you know , are Mother West Wind ''s children
        , had danced across the Green Meadows up to the old orchard , where they pelted
        each other with white and pink petals of apple blossoms until the ground was
        covered .

        Each apple-tree was like a huge bouquet of loveliness .

        Yes , indeed , it was very beautiful that spring morning .

        Sammy Jay had gotten up almost as early as Mr. Sun and Old Mother West Wind
        .

        As soon as he had swallowed his breakfast , he flew up to the old orchard
        and hid among the white and pink apple blossoms to watch for Johnny Chuck
        .

        You see , he knew that Johnny Chuck had some sort of a secret which filled
        Johnny with very great pride ; but what it was Sammy Jay could n''t even guess
        , and nothing troubles Sammy Jay quite so much as the feeling that he can
        not find out the secrets of other people .

        So he sat very , very still among the apple blossoms and waited and watched
        .

        By and by Johnny Chuck appeared on his doorstep .

        He seemed very much excited , did Johnny Chuck .

        He sat up very straight and looked this way and looked that way .

        He looked up in the apple-trees , and Sammy Jay held his breath , for fear
        that Johnny would see him .

        But Sammy was so well hidden that , bright as Johnny Chuck ''s eyes are ,
        they failed to see him .

        Then Johnny Chuck actually climbed up on the old stone wall so as to see better
        , and he sat there a long time , looking and looking .

        Sammy XXXXX grew impatient .'
