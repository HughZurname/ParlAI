        At first she would n''t go without a great deal of coaxing , but after a while
        he did n''t have to coax at all .

        She seemed to delight to be with him as much as he did to be with her .

        So Johnny Chuck grew happier and happier .

        He was happier than he had ever been in all his life before .

        You see Johnny Chuck had found the greatest thing in the world .

        Do you know what it is ?

        It is called love .

        XII JOHNNY CHUCK PROVES HIS LOVE These spring days were beautiful days on
        the Green Meadows .

        It seemed to Johnny Chuck that the Green Meadows never had been so lovely
        or the songs of the birds so sweet .

        He had forgotten all about his old friends , Jimmy Skunk and Peter Rabbit
        and the other little meadow people .

        You see , he could n''t think of anybody but Polly Chuck , and he did n''t
        want to be with anybody but Polly Chuck .

        He had even forgotten that he had started out to see the world .

        He did n''t care anything more about the world .

        All he wanted was to be where Polly Chuck was .

        Then he was perfectly happy .

        That was because Johnny Chuck had found the greatest thing in the world ,
        which is love .

        But Johnny still had one great wish , the wish that he might show Polly Chuck
        just how brave and strong he was and how well he could take care of her .

        One morning they were feasting in a patch of sweet clover over near an old
        stone wall .

        It was the same stone wall in which Johnny Chuck had escaped from old Whitetail
        the Marshhawk , when Johnny was a very little fellow .

        Suddenly Polly gave a little scream of fright .

        Johnny XXXXX looked up to see a dog almost upon her .'

        fur .

        .

        The Story Girl drew his limp body close in her arms .

        There was a plaintive little mew -- a long quiver -- and Paddy ''s friendly
        soul had fared forth to wherever it is that good cats go .

        `` He drank two full saucers of cream , '''' moaned Felicity , `` and I saw
        him catch a mouse in the evening .

        Maybe it was the last one he ever caught . ''''

        `` He did for many a mouse in his day , '''' said XXXXX , anxious to pay his
        tribute to the departed . '''''

        answered he .

        ` The ogre is coming after us .

        the darning needle behind her .

        In a moment it became an iron mountain between them and their enemy .

        ` We will break it down , my dog and I , '' cried the ogre in a rage , and
        they dashed at the mountain till they had forced a path through , and came
        ever nearer and nearer .

        ` They are close upon us ! ''

        cried the maiden , glancing behind , ` you must throw the pin . ''

        So Dschemil took the pin from his cloak and threw it behind him , and a dense
        thicket of thorns sprang up round them , which the ogre and his dog could
        not pass through . ''

        After supper Mohammed said to the owner of the tent , ` Your ram will kill

        So in the night Mohammed killed the greyhound , and laid his body across the

        Then he set up shrieks and yells , till he roused the Arab , who said ` Take
        the ram and go away . ''

        Mohammed did not need to be told twice , and at sunset he reached another
        Bedouin encampment .

        He was received kindly , as usual , and after supper he said to his host :
        ` Your daughter will kill my ram . ''

        ` Be silent , she will do nothing of the sort ; my daughter does not need
        to steal meat , she has some every day . ''

        When everybody was asleep , Mohammed got up , killed the ram , and took out

        He placed a piece of it in the girl ''s hands , and laid some more on her

        he cried , but she did not move or reply .

        Then he saw that she was dead , and rushed down to his brothers in the courtyard
        and called out , ` Come quickly , our sister is dead ! ''

        In a moment they were all beside her and knew that it was true , and they
        made a bier and laid her on it , and placed her across a camel , and said
        to the camel , ` Take her to her mother , but be careful not to halt by the
        way , and let no man capture you , and see you kneel down before no man ,

        So the camel started , and when it had accomplished half its journey it met

        Then they cried ` Stop ! ''

        but the camel only went the faster .

        The three men panted behind till one said to the others , ` Wait a minute

        The string of my sandal is broken ! ''

        The camel caught the word ` string '' and knelt down at once , and the men
        came up and found a dead girl lying on a bier , with a ring on her finger
        .

        And as one of the young men took hold of her hand to pull off the ring , he
        knocked out the man-eater ''s finger-nail , which had stuck there , and the
        maiden sat up and said , ` Let him live who gave me life , and slay him who
        slew me ! ''

        And when the camel heard the maiden speak , it turned and carried her back
        to her brothers .

        Now the brothers were still seated in the court bewailing their sister , and
        their eyes were dim with weeping so that they could hardly see .

        And when the camel stood before them they said , ` Perhaps it has brought
        back our sister ! ''

        and rose to give it a beating .

        But the camel knelt down and the girl dismounted , and they flung themselves
        on her neck and wept more than ever for gladness .

        came about , and what killed you . '' ''

        They began by naming her Graziella , and then Placida said : ` You know ,
        dear sisters , that the commonest form of spite or punishment amongst us consists
        of changing beauty to ugliness , cleverness to stupidity , and oftener still
        to change a person ''s form altogether .

        Now , as we can only each bestow one gift , I think the best plan will be
        for one of you to give her beauty , the other good understanding , whilst
        I will undertake that she shall never be changed into any other form . ''

        The two godmothers quite agreed , and as soon as the little princess had received
        their gifts , they went home , and Placida gave herself up to the child ''s
        education .

        She succeeded so well with it , and little Graziella grew so lovely , that
        when she was still quite a child her fame was spread abroad only too much
        , and one day Placida was surprised by a visit from the Fairy Queen , who
        was attended by a very grave and severe-looking fairy .

        The queen began at once : '' I have been much surprised by your behaviour
        to Mutinosa ; she had insulted our whole race , and deserved punishment .

        You might forgive your own wrongs if you chose , but not those of others .

        You treated her very gently whilst she was with you , and I come now to avenge
        our wrongs on her daughter .

        You have ensured her being lovely and clever , and not subject to change of
        form , but I shall place her in an enchanted prison , which she shall never
        leave till she finds herself in the arms of a lover whom she herself loves
        .

        It will be my care to prevent anything of the kind happening . ''

        The enchanted prison was a large high tower in the midst of the sea , built
        of shells of all shapes and colours .

        The lower floor was like a great bathroom , where the water was let in or
        off at will .

        The first floor contained the princess ''s apartments , beautifully furnished
        .

        On the second was a library , a large wardrobe-room filled with beautiful
        clothes and every kind of linen , a music room , a pantry with bins full of
        the best wines , and a store-room with all manner of preserves , bonbons ,
        pastry and cakes , all of which remained as fresh as if just out of the oven
        .

        The top of the tower was laid out like a garden , with beds of the loveliest
        flowers , fine fruit trees , and shady arbours and shrubs , where many birds
        sang amongst the branches .

        The fairies escorted Graziella and her governess , Bonnetta , to the tower
        , and then mounted a dolphin which was waiting for them .

        At a little distance from the tower the queen waved her wand and summoned
        two thousand great fierce sharks , whom she ordered to keep close guard ,
        and not to let a soul enter the tower .

        The good governess took such pains with Graziella ''s education that when
        she was nearly grown up she was not only most accomplished , but a very sweet
        , good girl .

        One day , as the princess was standing on a balcony , she saw the most extraordinary
        figure rise out of the sea .

        She quickly called Bonnetta to ask her what it could be .

        It looked like some kind of man , with a bluish face and long sea-green hair
        .

        He was swimming towards the tower , but the sharks XXXXX no notice of him

        One day Mrs. Griggs went away from the Dale place with a very curious story
        , which she diligently spread far and wide .

        It made a good deal of talk , but people , although they listened eagerly
        , and wondered and questioned , were rather incredulous about it .

        They thought Mrs. Griggs must be drawing considerably upon her imagination
        ; there were not lacking those who declared that she had invented the whole
        account , since her reputation for strict veracity was not wholly unquestioned
        .

        Mrs. Griggs ''s story was as follows : -- One day she found the door of the
        west gable unlocked .

        She went in , expecting to see bare walls and a collection of odds and ends
        .

        Instead she found herself in a finely furnished room .

        Delicate lace curtains hung before the small , square , broad-silled windows
        .

        The walls were adorned with pictures in much finer taste than Mrs. Griggs
        could appreciate .

        There was a bookcase between the windows filled with choicely bound books
        .

        Beside it stood a little table with a very dainty work-basket on it .

        By the basket Mrs. Griggs saw a pair of tiny scissors and a silver thimble
        .

        A wicker rocker , comfortable with silk cushions , was near it .

        Above the bookcase a woman ''s picture hung -- a water-colour , if Mrs. Griggs
        had but known it -- representing a pale , very sweet face , with large , dark
        eyes and a wistful expression under loose masses of black , lustrous hair
        .

        Just beneath the picture , on the top shelf of the bookcase , was a vaseful
        of flowers .

        Another vaseful stood on the table beside the basket .

        All this was astonishing enough .

        But what puzzled Mrs. Griggs completely was the fact that a woman ''s dress
        was hanging over a chair before the mirror -- a pale blue , silken affair
        .

        And on the floor beside it were two little blue satin slippers !

        Good Mrs. Griggs did not leave the room until she had thoroughly explored
        it , even to shaking out the blue dress and discovering it to be a tea-gown
        -- wrapper , she called it .

        But she found nothing to throw any light on the mystery .

        The fact that the simple name `` Alice '''' was written XXXXX the fly-leaves
        of all the books only deepened it , for it was a name unknown in the Dale
        family .'

        ESSAY ON SHAKESPEARE Shakespeare ''s full name was William Shakespeare .

        He did not always spell it the same way .

        He lived in the reign of Queen Elizabeth and wrote a great many plays .

        His plays are written in dialogue form .

        Some people think they were not written by Shakespeare but by another man
        of the same name .

        I have read some of them because our school teacher says everybody ought to
        read them , but I did not care much for them .

        There are some things in them I can not understand .

        I like the stories of Valeria H. Montague in the Family Guide ever so much
        better .

        They are more exciting and truer to life .

        Romeo and Juliet was one of the plays I read .

        It was very sad .

        Juliet dies and I do n''t like stories where people die .

        I like it better when they all get married especially to dukes and earls .

        Shakespeare himself was married to Anne Hatheway .

        They are both dead now .

        They have been dead a good while .

        He was a very famous man .

        snapped Sammy Jay .

        `` That ''s for you to find out , '''' replied Johnny Chuck .

        `` There ''s foolish pride and silly pride and pride of low degree ; A better
        pride is honest pride , and that ''s the pride for me . ''''

        And with that , Johnny Chuck disappeared in his new house .

        XX SAMMY JAY UNDERSTANDS It was a beautiful morning .

        Jolly , round , red Mr. Sun had thrown his bedclothes off very early and started
        to climb up the sky , smiling his broadest .

        Old Mother West Wind had swept his path clear of clouds .

        The Merry Little Breezes , who , you know , are Mother West Wind ''s children
        , had danced across the Green Meadows up to the old orchard , where they pelted
        each other with white and pink petals of apple blossoms until the ground was
        covered .

        Each apple-tree was like a huge bouquet of loveliness .

        Yes , indeed , it was very beautiful that spring morning .

        Sammy Jay had gotten up almost as early as Mr. Sun and Old Mother West Wind
        .

        As soon as he had swallowed his breakfast , he flew up to the old orchard
        and hid among the white and pink apple blossoms to watch for Johnny Chuck
        .

        You see , he knew that Johnny Chuck had some sort of a secret which filled
        Johnny with very great pride ; but what it was Sammy Jay could n''t even guess
        , and nothing troubles Sammy Jay quite so much as the feeling that he can
        not find out the secrets of other people .

        So he sat very , very still among the apple blossoms and waited and watched
        .

        By and by Johnny Chuck appeared on his doorstep .

        He seemed very much excited , did Johnny Chuck .

        He sat up very straight and looked this way and looked that way .

        He looked up in the apple-trees , and Sammy Jay held his breath , for fear
        that Johnny would see him .

        But Sammy was so well hidden that , bright as Johnny Chuck ''s eyes are ,
        they failed to see him .

        Then Johnny Chuck actually climbed up on the old stone wall so as to see better
        , and he sat there a long time , looking and looking .

        Sammy XXXXX grew impatient .'
