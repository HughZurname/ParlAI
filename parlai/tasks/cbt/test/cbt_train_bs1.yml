      The Queen kissed her , and said : `` Well , to please you , let me see what
      I can do for this cross Bruno . ''''

      And with a wave of her wand she turned the poor little cottage into a splendid
      palace , full of treasures ; only the two stools and the straw bed remained
      just as they were , to remind him of his former poverty .

      Then the Queen touched Bruno himself , and made him gentle and polite and grateful
      , and he thanked her and the Princess a thousand times .

      Lastly , the Queen restored the hen and the cabbages to their natural forms
      , and left them all very contented .

      The Prince and Princess were married as soon as possible with great splendor
      , and lived happily ever after .

      -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- Fortunee .

      Par Madame la Comtesse d''Aulnoy .

      THE WHITE CAT Once upon a time there was a king who had three sons , who were
      all so clever and brave that he began to be afraid that they would want to reign
      over the kingdom before he was dead .

      Now the King , though he felt that he was growing old , did not at all wish
      to give up the government of his kingdom while he could still manage it very
      well , so he thought the best way to live in peace would be to divert the minds
      of his sons by promises which he could always get out of when the time came
      for keeping them .

      So he sent for them all , and , after speaking to them kindly , he added : ``
      You will quite agree with me , my dear children , that my great age makes it
      impossible for me to look after my affairs of state as carefully as I once did
      .

      I begin to fear that this may affect the welfare of my subjects , therefore
      I wish that one of you should succeed to my crown ; but in return for such a
      gift as this it is only right that you should do something for me .

      Now , as I think of retiring into the country , it seems to me that a pretty
      , lively , faithful little dog would be very good company for me ; so , without
      any regard for your ages , I promise that the one who brings me the most beautiful
      little dog shall succeed me at once . ''''

      The three Princes were greatly surprised by their father ''s sudden fancy for
      a little dog , but as it gave the two younger ones a chance they would not otherwise
      have had of being king , and as the eldest was too polite to make any objection
      , they accepted the commission with pleasure .

      They bade farewell to the King , who gave them presents of silver and precious
      stones , and appointed to meet them at the same hour , in the same place , after
      a year had passed , to see the little dogs they had brought for him .

      Then they went together to a castle which was about a league from the city ,
      accompanied by all their particular friends , to whom they gave a grand banquet
      , and the three brothers promised to be friends always , to share whatever good
      fortune befell them , and not to be parted by any envy or jealousy ; and so
      they set out , agreeing to meet at the same castle at the appointed time , to
      present themselves before the King together .

      Each one took a different road , and the two eldest met with many adventures
      ; but it is about the youngest that you are going to hear .

      He was young , and gay , and handsome , and knew everything that a prince ought
      to know ; and as for his courage , there was simply no end to it .

      Hardly a day passed without his buying several dogs -- big and little , greyhounds
      , mastiffs , spaniels , and lapdogs .

      As soon as he had bought a pretty one he was sure to see a still prettier ,
      and then he had to get rid of all the others and buy that one , as , being alone
      , he found it impossible to take thirty or forty thousand dogs about with him
      .

      He journeyed from day to day , not knowing where he was going , until at last
      , just at nightfall , he reached a great , gloomy forest .

      He did not know his way , and , to make matters worse , it XXXXX to thunder
      , and the rain poured down .'

      He was as much merrier than you , for instance , as you are merrier than your
      father .

      Sometimes he fell , like a spinning-top , from sheer merriment .

      Have you seen a greyhound leaping the fences of the Gardens ?

      That is how Peter leaps them .

      And think of the music of his pipe .

      Gentlemen who walk home at night write to the papers to say they heard a nightingale
      in the Gardens , but it is really Peter ''s pipe they hear .

      Of course , he had no mother -- at least , what use was she to him ?

      You can be sorry for him for that , but do n''t be too sorry , for the next
      thing I mean to tell you is how he revisited her .

      It was the fairies who gave him the chance .

      -LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` The Thrush ''s Nest '' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration
      : Headpiece to ` Lock-out Time '' -RSB- IV LOCK-OUT TIME It is frightfully difficult
      to know much about the fairies , and almost the only thing known for certain
      is that there are fairies wherever there are children .

      Long ago children were forbidden the Gardens , and at that time there was not
      a fairy in the place ; then the children were admitted , and the fairies came
      trooping in that very evening .

      They ca n''t resist following the children , but you seldom see them , partly
      because they live in the daytime behind the railings , where you are not allowed
      to go , and also partly because they are so cunning .

      They are not a bit cunning after Lock-out , but until Lock-out , my word !

      -LSB- Illustration : They are so cunning -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : When they
      think you are not looking they skip along pretty lively -LRB- missing from book
      -RRB- -RSB- When you were a bird you knew the fairies pretty well , and you
      remember a good deal about them in your babyhood , which it is a great pity
      you ca n''t write down , for gradually you forget , and I have heard of children
      who declared that they had never once seen a fairy .

      Very likely if they said this in the Kensington Gardens , they were standing
      looking at a fairy all the time .

      The reason they were cheated was that she pretended to be something else .

      This is one of their best tricks .

      They usually pretend to be flowers , because the court sits in the Fairies ''
      Basin , and there are so many flowers there , and all along the Baby Walk ,
      that a flower is the thing least likely to attract attention .

      They dress exactly like flowers , and change with the seasons , putting on white
      when lilies are in and blue for bluebells , and so on .

      They like crocus and hyacinth time best of all , as they are partial to a bit
      of colour , but tulips -LRB- except white ones , which are the fairy cradles
      -RRB- they consider garish , and they sometimes put off dressing like tulips
      for days , so that the beginning of the tulip weeks is almost the best time
      to catch them .

      When they think you are not looking they XXXXX along pretty lively , but if
      you look , and they fear there is no time to hide , they stand quite still pretending
      to be flowers .'

      `` I ''ll just fill my stomach before I go into the Old Pasture , for there
      may not be any clover there , '''' said Peter .

      `` You ''d better be careful , Peter Rabbit , '''' said a wee warning voice

      `` There ''s nothing to be afraid of way up here ! ''''

      A shadow drifted across the sweet clover patch .

      Peter saw it .

      `` That must be made by a cloud crossing the moon , '''' said Peter , and he
      was so sure of it that he did n''t even look up to see , but boldly hopped out
      to fill his stomach .

      Just as he reached the patch of clover , the shadow drifted over it again .

      Then all in a flash a terrible thought entered Peter ''s head .

      He did n''t stop to look up .

      He suddenly sprang sideways , and even as he did so , sharp claws tore his coat
      and hurt him dreadfully .

      He twisted and dodged and jumped and turned this way and that way , and all
      the time the shadow followed him .

      Once again sharp claws tore his coat and made him squeal with pain .

      At last , when his breath was almost gone , he reached the edge of the Old Pasture

      In the first place , he had seen old Granny Fox and Reddy Fox hanging about
      a little way off , and though they had disappeared after a while , Danny had
      an idea that they were not far away , but were hiding so that they might catch
      him on his way home .

      Of course , he had n''t the slightest intention of giving them the chance .

      He had made up his mind to ask Peter if he might spend the night in a corner
      of the Old Briar-patch , and he was very sure that Peter would say he might
      , for he and Peter are very good friends , very good friends indeed .

      The second good reason Danny had for waiting was this very friendship .

      You see , Peter had been away from the Green Meadows so long that Danny felt
      sure he could n''t know all about how things were there now , and so he wanted
      to warn Peter that the Green Meadows were not nearly as safe as before Old Man
      Coyote had come there to live .

      So Danny waited , and when all the rest of the callers had left he called Peter
      to one side where little Mrs. Peter could n''t hear .

      Danny stood up on his hind legs so as to whisper in one of Peter ''s ears .

      `` Do you know that Old Man Coyote is the most dangerous enemy we have , Peter
      Rabbit ?

      Do you know that ? ''''

      he asked .

      Peter Rabbit shook his head .

      `` I do n''t believe that , Danny , '''' said he .

      `` His terrible voice has frightened you so that you just think him as bad as
      he sounds .

      Why , Old Man Coyote is a friend of mine . ''''

      Then he told Danny how Old Man Coyote had done him a good turn In the Old Pasture
      in return for a good turn Peter had once done him , and how he said that he
      always paid his debts .

      Danny Meadow Mouse looked doubtful .

      `` What else did he say ? ''''

      he demanded .

      `` Nothing , excepting that we were even now , '''' replied Peter .

      `` Ha ! ''''

      ` You have guessed right , '' replied Lyma .

      The mother of the Stalos looked round for her iron cane , which she always used
      to kill her victims , but it was not there , for Lyma had put it in the fire
      .

      ` Where is my iron cane ? ''

      asked the old woman .

      ` There ! ''

      answered Lyma , pointing to the flames .

      The old woman sprang forwards and seized it , but her clothes caught fire ,
      and in a few minutes she was burned to ashes .

      So the Sodno brothers found the treasure , and they carried it , and their sister
      and the reindeer , to their own home , and were the richest men in all Lapland
      .

      Andras Baive -LSB- From Lapplandische Marchen , J. C. Poestion . -RSB-

      Once upon a time there lived in Lapland a man who was so very strong and swift
      of foot that nobody in his native town of Vadso could come near him if they
      were running races in the summer evenings .

      The people of Vadso were very proud of their champion , and thought that there
      was no one like him in the world , till , by-and-by , it came to their ears
      that there dwelt among the mountains a Lapp , Andras Baive by name , who was
      said by his friends to be even stronger and swifter than the bailiff .

      Of course not a creature in Vadso believed that , and declared that if it made
      the mountaineers happier to talk such nonsense , why , let them !

      The winter was long and cold , and the thoughts of the villagers were much busier
      with wolves than with Andras Baive , when suddenly , on a frosty day , he made
      his appearance in the little town of Vadso .

      The bailiff was delighted at this chance of trying his strength , and at once
      went out to seek Andras and to coax him into giving proof of his vigour .

      As he walked along his eyes fell upon a big eight-oared boat that lay upon the
      shore , and his face shone with pleasure .

      ` That is the very thing , '' laughed he , '' I will make him jump over that
      boat . ''

      Andras was quite ready to accept the challenge , and they soon settled the terms
      of the wager .

      He who could jump over the boat without so much as touching it with his heel
      was to be the winner , and would get a large sum of money as the prize .

      So , followed by many of the villagers , the two men walked down to the sea
      .

      An old fisherman was chosen to stand near the boat to watch fair play , and
      to hold the stakes , and Andras , as the stranger was told to jump first .

      Going back to the flag which had been stuck into the sand to mark the starting
      place , he ran forward , XXXXX his head well thrown back , and cleared the boat
      with a mighty bound .'
